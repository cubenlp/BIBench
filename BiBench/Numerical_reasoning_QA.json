                "26 | 2009 annual report in fiscal 2008 , revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 14% ( 14 % ) from fiscal 2007 . all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 . license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys ae , our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions , experienced strong sales throughout the year . support and service revenue , which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment , experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in in-house support . gross profit in this business segment increased $ 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 , due primarily to the increase in license revenue , which carries the highest margins . liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company 2019s cash and cash equivalents increased to $ 118251 at june 30 , 2009 from $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 . the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows : 2009 2008 2007 .\n<table

ended june 30 , 2009 as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 . this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 . this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years . further , we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2009 was $ 59227 and includes $ 3027 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $ 31562 compared to $ 31105 for fiscal 2008 . cash used for software development in fiscal 2009 was $ 24684 compared to $ 23736 during the prior year . net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was $ 94675 and includes the repurchase of 3106 shares of our common stock for $ 58405 , the payment of dividends of $ 26903 and $ 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock ( through the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . beginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . since that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn . while we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .\nquestion:what is the net cash from operating activities in 2009?",

however , the company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates . the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments . because the company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components . the company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns . gross margin declined to 23% ( 23 % ) of net sales in 2001 from 27% ( 27 % ) in 2000 . this decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% ( 2 % ) experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% ( 26 % ) gross margin for the same quarter in 2000 . in addition to lower than normal net .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>2002</td><td>2001</td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>net sales</td><td>$ 5742</td><td>$ 5363</td><td>$ 7983</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>cost of sales</td><td>4139</td><td>4128</td><td>5817</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>gross margin</td><td>$ 1603</td><td>$ 1235</td><td>$ 2166</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>gross margin percentage</td><td>28% ( 28 % )</td><td>23% ( 23 % )</td><td>27% ( 27 % )</td></tr></table>\n.\nquestion:what was the total of net sales in 2001?",

[2] estimated life , annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims , policy surrenders , policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts . estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality , morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with life 2019s historical experience , modified for recent observed trends . life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs . in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits . therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities . due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results . as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations , the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets . life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future deposits and premiums . [3] includes contractual principal and interest payments . payments exclude amounts associated with fair-value hedges of certain of the company 2019s long-term debt . all long-term debt obligations have fixed rates of interest . long-term debt obligations also includes principal and interest payments of $ 700 and $ 2.4 billion , respectively , related to junior subordinated debentures which are callable beginning in 2006 . see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations .

                "2022 timing of available information , including the performance of first lien positions , and 2022 limitations of available historical data . pnc 2019s determination of the alll for non-impaired loans is sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and loss rates for consumer loans . there are several other qualitative and quantitative factors considered in determining the alll . this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll . it is intended to provide insight into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and loss rates only and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates . given the current processes used , we believe the risk grades and loss rates currently assigned are appropriate . in the hypothetical event that the aggregate weighted average commercial loan risk grades would experience a 1% ( 1 % ) deterioration , assuming all other variables remain constant , the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $ 35 million as of december 31 , 2014 . in the hypothetical event that consumer loss rates would increase by 10% ( 10 % ) , assuming all other variables remain constant , the allowance for consumer loans would increase by approximately $ 37 million at december 31 , 2014 . purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition . because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component , additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date . at december 31 , 2014 , we had established reserves of $ .9 billion for purchased impaired loans . in addition , loans ( purchased impaired and non- impaired ) acquired after january 1 , 2009 were recorded at fair value . no allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition . see note 4 purchased loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . in determining the appropriateness of the alll , we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans . we also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions , which may not be reflected in historical loss data . commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the alll . we have allocated approximately $ 1.6 billion , or 47% ( 47 % ) , of the alll at december 31 , 2014 to the commercial lending category . consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity . approximately $ 1.7 billion , or 53% ( 53 % ) , of the alll at december 31 , 2014 has been allocated to these consumer lending categories . in addition to the alll , we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit . we report this allowance as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet . we maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities . we determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures . other than the estimation of the probability of funding , this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our alll . we refer you to note 1 accounting policies and note 3 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances . table 41 : allowance for loan and lease losses .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>dollars in

ratios are not applicable until 2019 , we believe that the estimated ratios in the table above are meaningful because they are measures that we , our regulators and investors use to assess our ability to meet future regulatory capital requirements . the estimated fully phased-in basel iii advanced and standardized cet1 ratios are non-gaap measures as of both december 2014 and december 2013 and may not be comparable to similar non-gaap measures used by other companies ( as of those dates ) . these estimated ratios are based on our current interpretation , expectations and understanding of the revised capital framework and may evolve as we discuss its interpretation and application with our regulators . see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our transitional capital ratios , which represent our binding ratios as of december 2014 . in the table above : 2030 the deduction for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets , net of deferred tax liabilities , represents goodwill of $ 3.65 billion and $ 3.71 billion as of december 2014 and december 2013 , respectively , and identifiable intangible assets of $ 515 million and $ 671 million as of december 2014 and december 2013 , respectively , net of associated deferred tax liabilities of $ 964 million and $ 908 million as of december 2014 and december 2013 , respectively . 2030 the deduction for investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions represents the amount by which our investments in the capital of nonconsolidated financial institutions exceed certain prescribed thresholds . the decrease from december 2013 to december 2014 primarily reflects reductions in our fund investments . 2030 other adjustments primarily include the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation , net of associated deferred tax liabilities , and disallowed deferred tax assets , credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities and debt valuation adjustments , as well as other required credit risk-based deductions . supplementary leverage ratio the revised capital framework introduces a new supplementary leverage ratio for advanced approach banking organizations . under amendments to the revised capital framework , the u.s . federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule that implements the supplementary leverage ratio aligned with the definition of leverage established by the basel committee . the supplementary leverage ratio compares tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure , defined as the sum of our quarterly average assets less certain deductions plus certain off-balance-sheet exposures , including a measure of derivatives exposures and commitments . the revised capital framework requires a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) ( comprised of the minimum requirement of 3.0% ( 3.0 % ) and a 2.0% ( 2.0 % ) buffer ) for u.s . banks deemed to be g-sibs , effective on january 1 , 2018 . certain disclosures regarding the supplementary leverage ratio are required beginning in the first quarter of 2015 . as of december 2014 , our estimated supplementary leverage ratio was 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) , including tier 1 capital on a fully phased-in basis of $ 73.17 billion ( cet1 of $ 64.26 billion plus perpetual non-cumulative preferred stock of $ 9.20 billion less other adjustments of $ 290 million ) divided by total leverage exposure of $ 1.45 trillion ( total quarterly average assets of $ 873 billion plus adjustments of $ 579 billion , primarily comprised of off-balance-sheet exposure related to derivatives and commitments ) . we believe that the estimated supplementary leverage ratio is meaningful because it is a measure that we , our regulators and investors use to assess our ability to meet future regulatory capital requirements . the supplementary leverage ratio is a non-gaap measure and may not be comparable to similar non-gaap measures used by other

reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib . these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income . in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 . the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves . changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses . ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing . adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income . when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements . therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward . the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates . following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization . however , if market conditions improved following a downturn , sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims , which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income . as of december 31 , 2008 , management established the sop 03-1 reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december 31 , 2008 . management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short-term market movements impact the sop 03-1 reserve . the sop 03-1 reserve is based on the calculation of a long-term benefit ratio ( or loss ratio ) for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance . despite the long-term nature of the risk the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient . management will , in keeping with the language in sop 03-1 , regularly examine both quantitative and qualitative analysis and management will determine if , in its judgment , the change in the calculated benefit ratio is of sufficient magnitude and has persisted for a sufficient duration to warrant a change in the benefit ratio used to establish the sop 03-1 reserve . this has no impact on either premium received or claims paid nor does it impact the long-term profit or loss of the variable annuity guaran- tee reinsurance . the sop 03-1 reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors , including equity levels , interest rate levels , credit risk and implied volatilities , as well as policyholder behaviors , such as annuitization and lapse rates . the table below shows the sensitivity , as of december 31 , 2008 , of the sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . in addition , the tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held ( hedge value ) , which includes instruments purchased in january 2009 , to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . although these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment , some portion of the change in value may be used to offset changes in the sop 03-1 reserve.

contributor of the assets , but no change in ownership interest may result from these contributions . an excess of ashland funded improvements over marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of marathon funded improvements over ashland funded improvements results in a net loss . cost of revenues increased by $ 5.822 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 6.040 billion in 2003 from 2002 . the increases are primarily in the rm&t segment and result from higher acquisition costs for crude oil , refined products , refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses . selling , general and administrative expenses increased by $ 105 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 97 million in 2003 from 2002 . the increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher costs associated with business transformation and outsourcing . our 2004 results were also impacted by start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea and the increased cost of complying with governmental regulations . the increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased employee benefit expenses ( caused by increased pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and a decrease in realized returns on plan assets ) and other employee related costs . additionally , during 2003 , we recorded a charge of $ 24 million related to organizational and business process changes . inventory market valuation reserve ( 2018 2018imv 2019 2019 ) is established to reduce the cost basis of inventories to current market value . generally , we will establish an imv reserve when crude oil prices fall below $ 22 per barrel . the 2002 results of operations include credits to income from operations of $ 71 million , reversing the imv reserve at december 31 , 2001 . net interest and other financial costs decreased by $ 25 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 82 million in 2003 from 2002 . the decrease in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income . the decrease in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased long-term construction projects , the favorable effect of interest rate swaps , the favorable effect of a reduction in interest on tax deficiencies and increased interest income on investments . additionally , included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency gains of $ 9 million , $ 13 million and $ 8 million for 2004 , 2003 and 2002 . loss from early extinguishment of debt in 2002 was attributable to the retirement of $ 337 million aggregate principal amount of debt , resulting in a loss of $ 53 million . minority interest in income of map , which represents ashland 2019s 38 percent ownership interest , increased by $ 230 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 129 million in 2003 from 2002 . map income was higher in 2004 compared to 2003 and in 2003 compared to 2002 as discussed below in the rm&t segment . minority interest in loss of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited , which represents gepetrol 2019s 25 percent ownership interest , was $ 7 million in 2004 , primarily resulting from gepetrol 2019s share of start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea . provision for income taxes increased by $ 143 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 215 million in 2003 from 2002 , primarily due to $ 388 million and $ 720 million increases in income before income taxes . the effective tax rate for 2004 was 36.6 percent compared to 36.6 percent and 42.1 percent for 2003 and 2002 . the higher rate in 2002 was due to the united kingdom enactment of a supplementary 10 percent tax on profits from the north sea oil and gas production , retroactively effective to april 17 , 2002 . in 2002 , we

from significantly higher paper and packaging price realizations . sales volumes were slightly high- er , with growth in overseas markets partially offset by lower volumes in north america as we continued to balance our production with our customers 2019 demand . operationally , our pulp and paper and containerboard mills ran very well in 2007 . however , input costs for wood , energy and transportation costs were all well above 2006 levels . in our forest products business , earnings decreased 31% ( 31 % ) reflect- ing a sharp decline in harvest income and a smaller drop in forestland and real estate sales , both reflect- ing our forestland divestitures in 2006 . interest expense decreased over 40% ( 40 % ) , principally due to lower debt balances and interest rates from debt repayments and refinancings . looking forward to the first quarter of 2008 , we expect demand for north american printing papers and packaging to remain steady . however , if the economic downturn in 2008 is greater than expected , this could have a negative impact on sales volumes and earnings . some slight increases in paper and packaging price realizations are expected as we implement our announced price increases . however , first quarter earnings will reflect increased planned maintenance expenses and continued escalation of wood , energy and transportation costs . as a result , excluding the impact of projected reduced earnings from land sales and the addition of equity earnings contributions from our recent investment in ilim holding s.a . in russia , we expect 2008 first-quarter earnings to be lower than in the 2007 fourth quarter . results of operations industry segment operating profits are used by inter- national paper 2019s management to measure the earn- ings performance of its businesses . management believes that this measure allows a better under- standing of trends in costs , operating efficiencies , prices and volumes . industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest , interest expense , corporate items and corporate special items . industry segment oper- ating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure , and are not gaap alternatives to net earn- ings or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . international paper operates in six segments : print- ing papers , industrial packaging , consumer pack- aging , distribution , forest products , and specialty businesses and other .

12.2 million for the years ended december 31 , 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively . note 10 . income taxes we and the majority of our subsidiaries are currently exempt from united states corporate tax on income from the international opera- tion of ships pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code . income tax expense related to our remaining subsidiaries was not significant for the years ended december 31 , 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . final regulations under section 883 were published on august 26 , 2003 , and were effective for the year ended december 31 , 2005 . these regulations confirmed that we qualify for the exemption provid- ed by section 883 , but also narrowed the scope of activities which are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships . the activities listed in the regula- tions as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and other transportation such as transfers , shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours . to the extent the income from such activities is earned from sources within the united states , such income will be subject to united states taxa- tion . the application of these new regulations reduced our net income for the years ended december 31 , 2006 and december 31 , 2005 by approximately $ 6.3 million and $

realized as of december 31 , 2006 or 2005 , or that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement . our financial instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes . our exposure under foreign currency contracts , interest rate and fuel swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts , all of which are currently our lending banks . to minimize this risk , we select counterparties with credit risks acceptable to us and we limit our exposure to an individual counterparty . furthermore , all foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in primary currencies . cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments . long-term debt the fair values of our senior notes and senior debentures were esti- mated by obtaining quoted market prices . the fair values of all other debt were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities . foreign currency contracts the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were esti- mated using current market prices for similar instruments . our expo- sure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to six ship construction contracts and forecasted transactions . we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . as of december 31 , 2006 , we had foreign currency forward contracts in a notional amount of $ 3.8 billion maturing through 2009 . as of december 31 , 2006 , the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the six ship construction contracts , which are designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized gain of approximately $ 106.3 mil- lion . at december 31 , 2005 , the fair value of our foreign currency for- ward contracts related to three ship construction contracts , designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized loss of approx- imately $ 103.4 million . the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the other ship construction contract at december 31 , 2005 , which was designated as a cash flow hedge , was an unre- alized loss , of approximately $ 7.8 million . at december 31 , 2006 , approximately 11% ( 11 % ) of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to

435 million excluding shutdown costs for a paper machine ) in 2008 and $ 415 million in 2007 . sales volumes decreased sig- nificantly in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weak customer demand and reduced production capacity resulting from the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill in december 2008 and the conversion of the bastrop mill to pulp production in june 2008 . average sales price realizations were lower reflecting slight declines for uncoated freesheet paper in domestic markets and significant declines in export markets . margins were also unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of shipments to lower-margin export markets . input costs , however , were favorable due to lower wood and chemical costs and sig- nificantly lower energy costs . freight costs were also lower . planned maintenance downtime costs in 2009 were comparable with 2008 . operating costs were favorable , reflecting cost control efforts and strong machine performance . lack-of-order downtime increased to 525000 tons in 2009 , including 120000 tons related to the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill in the 2008 fourth quarter , from 135000 tons in 2008 . operating earnings in 2009 included $ 671 million of alternative fuel mixture cred- its , $ 223 million of costs associated with the shutdown of our franklin mill and $ 9 million of other shutdown costs , while operating earnings in 2008 included $ 30 million of costs for the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill . looking ahead to 2010 , first-quarter sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from fourth-quarter 2009 levels . average sales price realizations should be higher , reflecting the full-quarter impact of sales price increases announced in the fourth quarter for converting and envelope grades of uncoated free- sheet paper and an increase in prices to export markets . however , input costs for wood , energy and chemicals are expected to continue to increase . planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower and operating costs should be favorable . brazil ian papers net sales for 2009 of $ 960 mil- lion increased from $ 950 million in 2008 and $ 850 million in 2007 . operating profits for 2009 were $ 112 million compared with $ 186 million in 2008 and $ 174 million in 2007 . sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflect- ing higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3 bil- lion compared with $ 1.7 billion in 2008 and $ 1.5 bil- lion in 2007 . operating profits in 2009 of $ 92 million ( $ 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie mill ) compared with $ 39 mil- lion ( $ 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie , scotland mill to their estimated realizable value ) in 2008 and $ 171 million in 2007 . sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourth-quarter levels despite solid customer demand . average sales price realizations are expected to increase over the quar- ter , primarily in eastern

notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 500 million at a 3.625% ( 3.625 % ) fixed , annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 , 2043 . interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year . the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $ 998 million . on november 1 , 2011 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $ 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $ 1.5 billion with lender approval . the facility matures november 1 , 2017 . as of and for the periods ended may 31 , 2015 and 2014 , we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility . we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . if our long- term debt ratings were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase . conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease . changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility . under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants . these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as a minimum capitalization ratio . in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable . as of may 31 , 2015 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future . liquidity is also provided by our $ 1 billion commercial paper program . during the year ended may 31 , 2015 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2015 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program . we may issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2016 depending on general corporate needs . we currently have short-term debt ratings

billion , of which $ 4.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries . included in cash and equivalents as of may 31 , 2015 was $ 968 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity . cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks , money market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s . treasury obligations , u.s . government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities . our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk . all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk . while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2015 the weighted average remaining duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 79 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification

                "cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period , as pension funding decisions , tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows . in both 2007 and 2006 , the company made discretionary contributions of $ 200 million to its u.s . qualified pension plan , and in 2005 made discretionary contributions totaling $ 500 million . in 2007 , cash flows provided by operating activities increased $ 436 million , including an increase in net income of $ 245 million . since the gain from sale of businesses is included in and increases net income , the pre-tax gain from the sale of the businesses must be subtracted , as shown above , to properly reflect operating cash flows . the cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities ; however , when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities . thus , operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $ 630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business . non-pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $ 475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments , which benefited cash flows . accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007 , but decreased cash flow less than in 2006 , resulting in a year-on-year benefit to cash flows of $ 323 million . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . in 2006 , cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $ 365 million . this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $ 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 . the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company 2019s repatriation of $ 1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including outstanding liabilities at december 31 , 2006 , related to 3m 2019s

and tapes , and respirators ) , a plant in china ( optical systems , industrial adhesives and tapes , and personal care ) , an expansion in canada ( construction and home improvement business ) , in addition to investments in india , mexico and other countries . in addition , 3m expanded manufacturing capabilities in the u.s. , including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical . 3m also exited several high-cost underutilized manufacturing facilities and streamlined several supply chains by relocating equipment from one facility to another . the streamlining work has primarily occurred inside the u.s . and is in addition to the streamlining achieved through plant construction . as a result of this increased activity , capital expenditures were $ 1.422 billion in 2007 , an

a net income increase of $ 47 million and an earnings per share decrease of $ 0.14 over 2001 . net income for 2002 reflected lower operating revenue ( $ 204 million ) , operating expenses ( $ 229 million ) and other income ( $ 27 million ) . interest expense and income taxes , which are discussed on a consolidated basis , decreased $ 50 million over 2001 . the earnings per share decrease reflected share dilution . regulated electric sales revenue increased $ 179 million . favorable weather conditions , reflecting increased cooling and heating degree-days , as well as customer growth , are estimated to have contributed $ 133 million and $ 41 million , respectively . fuel rate recoveries increased approximately $ 65 million for 2002 . these recoveries are generally offset by increases in elec- tric fuel expense and do not materially affect income . partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $ 60 million due to other factors not separately measurable , such as the impact of economic conditions on customer usage , as well as variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts . nonregulated electric sales revenue increased $ 9 million . sales revenue from dominion 2019s merchant generation fleet decreased $ 21 million , reflecting a $ 201 million decline due to lower prices partially offset by sales from assets acquired and constructed in 2002 and the inclusion of millstone operations for all of 2002 . revenue from the wholesale marketing of utility generation decreased $ 74 million . due to the higher demand of utility service territory customers during 2002 , less production from utility plant generation was available for profitable sale in the wholesale market . revenue from retail energy sales increased $ 71 million , reflecting primarily customer growth over the prior year . net revenue from dominion 2019s electric trading activities increased $ 33 million , reflecting the effect of favorable price changes on unsettled contracts and higher trading margins . nonregulated gas sales revenue decreased $ 351 million . the decrease included a $ 239 million decrease in sales by dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing opera- tions , reflecting to a large extent declining prices . revenue associated with gas trading operations , net of related cost of sales , decreased $ 112 million . the decrease included $ 70 mil- lion of realized and unrealized losses on the economic hedges of natural gas production by the dominion exploration & pro- duction segment . as described below under selected information 2014 energy trading activities , sales of natural gas by the dominion exploration & production segment at market prices offset these financial losses , resulting in a range of prices contemplated by dominion 2019s overall risk management strategy . the remaining $ 42 million decrease was due to unfavorable price changes on unsettled contracts and lower overall trading margins . those losses were partially offset by contributions from higher trading volumes in gas and oil markets . gas transportation and storage revenue decreased $ 44 million , primarily reflecting lower rates . electric fuel and energy purchases expense increased $ 94 million which included an increase of $ 66 million associated with dominion 2019s energy marketing operations that are not sub- ject to cost-based rate regulation and an increase of $ 28 million associated with utility operations . substantially all of the increase associated with non-regulated energy marketing opera- tions related to higher volumes purchased during the year . for utility operations , energy costs increased $ 66 million for pur- chases subject to rate recovery , partially offset by a $ 38 million decrease in fuel expenses associated with lower wholesale mar- keting of utility plant generation . purchased gas expense decreased $ 245 million associated with dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing oper- ations . this decrease reflected approximately $ 162 million asso- ciated with declining prices and $ 83 million associated with lower purchased volumes . liquids , pipeline capacity and other purchases decreased $ 64 million , primarily reflecting comparably lower levels of rate recoveries of certain costs of transmission operations in the cur- rent year period . the difference between actual expenses and amounts recovered in the period are deferred pending future rate adjustments . other operations and maintenance expense decreased $ 14 million , primarily reflecting an $ 18 million decrease in outage costs due to fewer generation unit outages in the current year . depreciation expense decreased $ 11 million , reflecting decreases in depreciation associated with changes in the esti- mated useful

( see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements ) . excluding this portion of cash held outside the u.s . for acquisition-related purposes , approximately 50%-60% ( 50%-60 % ) of the remaining cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries throughout the year . the amount of cash held by our u.s . and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors , including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business . cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs , capital expenditures , share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners . to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings , the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends ; however , not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the u.s . when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested , no accrual for taxes is provided. .\nquestion:what is the net income in 2012?",

actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured . based on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s . treasury and agency securities , municipal securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s . and non-u.s . mortgage- and asset-backed securities . the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time . we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. .\nquestion:what was the value of average short term advances in 2014?",

and about $ 245 million from fire control systems programs primarily related to the sof clss program , which began late in the third quarter of 2010 . partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales due to decreased volume of approximately $ 75 million primarily from various services programs and approximately $ 20 million from tactical missile programs ( primarily mlrs and jassm ) . mfc 2019s operating profit for 2011 increased $ 96 million , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of about $ 60 million for air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) as a result of increased volume and retirement of risks ;

                "consumer foods net sales increased $ 303 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , for the year to $ 6.8 billion . results reflect an increase of three percentage points from improved net pricing and product mix and two percentage points of improvement from higher volumes . net pricing and volume improvements were achieved in many of the company 2019s priority investment and enabler brands . the impact of product recalls partially offset these improvements . the company implemented significant price increases for many consumer foods products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 . continued net sales improvements are expected into fiscal 2009 when the company expects to receive the benefit of these pricing actions for full fiscal periods . sales of some of the company 2019s most significant brands , including chef boyardee ae , david ae , egg beaters ae , healthy choice ae , hebrew national ae , hunt 2019s ae , marie callender 2019s ae , manwich ae , orville redenbacher 2019s ae , pam ae , ro*tel ae , rosarita ae , snack pack ae , swiss miss ae , wesson ae , and wolf ae grew in fiscal 2008 . sales of act ii ae , andy capp ae , banquet ae , crunch 2018n munch ae , kid cuisine ae , parkay ae , pemmican ae , reddi-wip ae , and slim jim ae declined in fiscal 2008 . net sales in the consumer foods segment are not comparable across periods due to a variety of factors . the company initiated a peanut butter recall in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and reintroduced peter pan ae peanut butter products in august 2007 . sales of all peanut butter products , including both branded and private label , in fiscal 2008 were $ 14 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007 . consumer foods net sales were also adversely impacted by the recall of banquet ae and private label pot pies in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 . net sales of pot pies were lower by approximately $ 22 million in fiscal 2008 , relative to fiscal 2007 , primarily due to product returns and lost sales of banquet ae and private label pot pies . sales from alexia foods and lincoln snacks , businesses acquired in fiscal 2008 , totaled $ 66 million in fiscal 2008 . the company divested a refrigerated pizza business during the first half of fiscal 2007 . sales from this business were $ 17 million in fiscal food and ingredients net sales were $ 4.1 billion in fiscal 2008 , an increase of $ 706 million , or 21% ( 21 % ) . increased sales are reflective of higher sales prices in the company 2019s milling operations due to higher grain prices , and price and volume increases in the company 2019s potato and dehydrated vegetable operations . the fiscal 2007 divestiture of an oat milling operation resulted in a reduction of sales of $ 27 million for fiscal 2008 , partially offset by increased sales of $ 18 million from the acquisition of watts brothers in february 2008 . international foods net sales increased $ 65 million to $ 678 million . the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s . dollar accounted for approximately $ 36 million of this increase . the segment achieved a 5% ( 5 % ) increase in sales volume in fiscal 2008 , primarily reflecting increased unit sales in canada and mexico , and modest increases in net pricing . gross profit ( net sales less cost of goods sold ) ( $ in millions ) reporting segment fiscal 2008 gross profit fiscal 2007 gross profit % (  % ) increase/ ( decrease ) .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>reporting segment</td><td>fiscal 2008 gross profit</td><td>fiscal 2007 gross profit</td><td>% (  % ) increase/ ( decrease )</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>consumer foods</td><td>$ 1802</td><td>$ 1923</td><td>( 6 ) % (  % )</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>food and ingredients</td><td>724</td><td>590</td><td>23% ( 23 % )</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>international foods</td><td>190</td><td>180</td><td>6% ( 6 % )</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>total</td><td>$ 2716</td><td>$ 2693</td><td>1% ( 1 % )</td></tr></table>\nthe company 2019s gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $ 2.7 billion , an increase of $ 23 million , or 1% ( 1 % ) , over the prior year . the increase in gross profit was largely driven by results in the food and ingredients segment , reflecting higher margins in the company 2019s milling and specialty potato operations , largely offset by reduced gross profits in the consumer foods segment . costs of implementing the company 2019s restructuring plans reduced gross profit by $ 4 million and $ 46 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 , respectively. .\nquestion:what is the gross profit generated by consumer foods in 2007?",

both fiscal 2017 and 2016 . although relatively consistent year-over-year , our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies , valuation allowances , changes in tax laws , outcomes of administrative audits , the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u.s . operations and

other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet . as of december 31 , 2018 , a 5 percent change in our global sales return , rebate , and discount liability would have led to an

approximately 90 percent as of december 31 , 2018 and december 31 , 2017 . the following represents a roll-forward of our most significant u.s . pharmaceutical sales return , rebate , and discount

and other contingencies are , by their nature , uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities . the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation , the nature and the number of other similar current and past matters , the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation , and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions , if any . in addition , we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred , but not filed , to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage . we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable . we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance . in assessing our insurance coverage , we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions , the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company , the financial condition of the insurers , and the possibility of and length of time for collection . due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance , we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products . in addition to insurance coverage , we also consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated . with respect to our third-party indemnification rights , these considerations include the nature of the indemnification , the financial condition of the indemnifying party , and the possibility of and length of time for collection . the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets , respectively , on our consolidated balance sheets . impairment of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets background and uncertainties we review the carrying value of long-lived assets ( both intangible and tangible ) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset ( or asset group ) may not be recoverable . we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset ( or asset group ) to its carrying value . if an impairment is identified , a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset 2019s net book value over its fair value , and the cost basis is adjusted . goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present . when required , a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment. .\nquestion:what was the change in the total of u.s . pharmaceutical sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care, medicare, and medicaid

                "citigroup 2019s repurchases are primarily from government sponsored entities . the specific representations and warranties made by the company depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer . market conditions and credit-ratings agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions the company may agree to in loan sales . in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties , the company may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans ( generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest ) with the identified defects or indemnify ( 201cmake-whole 201d ) the investor or insurer . the company has recorded a repurchase reserve that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet . in the case of a repurchase , the company will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans . the company 2019s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage . however , contractual liability arises only when the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss results from the breach . in the case of a repurchase , the loan is typically considered a credit- impaired loan and accounted for under sop 03-3 , 201caccounting for certain loans and debt securities , acquired in a transfer 201d ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 , receivables 2014loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality ) . these repurchases have not had a material impact on nonperforming loan statistics , because credit-impaired purchased sop 03-3 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans . the company estimates its exposure to losses from its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans based on the probability of repurchase or make-whole and an estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole . this estimate is calculated separately by sales vintage ( i.e. , the year the loans were sold ) based on a combination of historical trends and forecasted repurchases and losses considering the : ( 1 ) trends in requests by investors for loan documentation packages to be reviewed ; ( 2 ) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes ; ( 3 ) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests ; ( 4 ) success rate in appealing claims ; ( 5 ) inventory of unresolved claims ; and ( 6 ) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole , including the loss of principal , accrued interest , and foreclosure costs . the company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty , but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve . the request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim . during 2009 , loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased . in addition , our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience . these factors contributed to a $ 493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009 . as indicated above , the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage . the majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages , which also represent the vintages with the largest loss- given-repurchase . an insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006 , and this is expected to decrease , because those vintages are later in the credit cycle . although early in the credit cycle , the company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages . in the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired sop 03-3 loan ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 ) , the difference between the loan 2019s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve . payments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve . the provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale , which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . a liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the company sells loans and is updated quarterly . any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . the activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended december 31 , 2009 and 2008 is as follows: .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>in millions of dollars</td><td>2009</td><td>2008</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>balance beginning of the year</td><td>$ 75</td><td>$ 2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>additions for new sales</td><td>33</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>change in estimate</td><td>493</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>utilizations</td><td>-119 ( 119 )</td><td>-9 ( 9 )</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>balance end of the year</td><td>$ 482</td><td>$ 75</td></tr></table>\ngoodwill goodwill represents an acquired company 2019s acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired . goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests , whereby goodwill is allocated to the company 2019s reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value . furthermore , on any business dispositions , goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit . intangible assets intangible assets 2014including core deposit intangibles , present value of future profits , purchased credit card relationships , other customer relationships , and other intangible assets , but excluding msrs 2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives . intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives , primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names , are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests . an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value . for other intangible assets subject to amortization , an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset . other assets and other liabilities other assets include , among other items , loans held-for-sale , deferred tax assets , equity-method investments , interest and fees receivable , premises and equipment , end-user derivatives in a net receivable position , repossessed assets , and other receivables. .\nquestion:what is the end year balance of the repurchase reserve in 2009?",

                "note 12 2013 stock-based compensation during 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , we recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaling $ 189 million , $ 167 million , and $ 157 million , which is included as a component of other unallocated costs on our statements of earnings . the net impact to earnings for the respective years was $ 122 million , $ 108 million , and $ 101 million . as of december 31 , 2013 , we had $ 132 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years . we received cash from the exercise of stock options totaling $ 827 million , $ 440 million , and $ 116 million during 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 . in addition , our income tax liabilities for 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were reduced by $ 158 million , $ 96 million , and $ 56 million due to recognized tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements . stock-based compensation plans under plans approved by our stockholders , we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards , including options to purchase common stock , stock appreciation rights , restricted stock units ( rsus ) , performance stock units ( psus ) , or other stock units . the exercise price of options to purchase common stock may not be less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant . no award of stock options may become fully vested prior to the third anniversary of the grant , and no portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year . the minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is three years . award agreements may provide for shorter or pro-rated vesting periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death , disability , divestiture , retirement , change of control , or layoff . the maximum term of a stock option or any other award is 10 years . at december 31 , 2013 , inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding stock options , rsus and psus , we had 20.4 million shares reserved for issuance under the plans . at december 31 , 2013 , 4.7 million of the shares reserved for issuance remained available for grant under our stock-based compensation plans . we issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or when restrictions on rsus and psus have been satisfied . the following table summarizes activity related to nonvested rsus during 2013 : number of rsus ( in thousands ) weighted average grant-date fair value per share .\n<table

are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant . employees who are granted rsus receive the right to receive shares of stock after completion of the vesting period , however , the shares are not issued , and the employees cannot sell or transfer shares prior to vesting and have no voting rights until the rsus vest , generally three years from the date of the award . employees who are granted rsus receive dividend-equivalent cash payments only upon vesting . for these rsu awards , the grant-date fair value is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments . we recognize the grant-date fair value of rsus , less estimated forfeitures , as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period , which beginning with the rsus granted in 2013 is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period . stock options we generally recognize compensation cost for stock options ratably over the three-year vesting period . at december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , there were 10.2 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 83.65 ) and 20.6 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 83.15 ) stock options outstanding . stock options outstanding at december 31 , 2013 have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately five years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $ 663 million , and we expect nearly all of these stock options to vest . of the stock options outstanding , 7.7 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 84.37 ) have vested as of december 31 , 2013 and those stock options have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately four years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $ 497 million . there were 10.1 million ( weighted average exercise price of $ 82.72 ) stock options

one of citigroup 2019s local consumer lending 2014cards reporting unit impairment test at july 1 , 2010 , goodwill present in the reporting unit may be sensitive to further deterioration as the valuation of the reporting unit is particularly dependent upon economic conditions that affect consumer credit risk and behavior . citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the valuation of the reporting unit at july 1 , 2010 , using a combination of the market approach and income approach consistent with the valuation model used in past practice , which considered the impact of the penalty fee provisions associated with the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( card act ) that were implemented during 2010 . under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit , the key assumption is the selected price multiple . the selection of the multiple considers the operating performance and financial condition of the local consumer lending 2014cards operations as compared with those of a group of selected publicly traded guideline companies and a group of selected acquired companies . among other factors , the level and expected growth in return on tangible equity relative to those of the guideline companies and guideline transactions is considered . since the guideline company prices used are on a minority interest basis , the selection of the multiple considers the guideline acquisition prices , which reflect control rights and privileges , in arriving at a multiple that reflects an appropriate control premium . for the local consumer lending 2014cards valuation under the income approach , the assumptions used as the basis for the model include cash flows for the forecasted period , the assumptions embedded in arriving at an estimation of the terminal value and the discount rate . the cash flows for the forecasted period are estimated based on management 2019s most recent projections available as of the testing date , giving consideration to targeted equity capital requirements based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit . in arriving at the terminal value for local consumer lending 2014cards , using 2013 as the terminal year , the assumptions used include a long-term growth rate and a price-to-tangible book multiple based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit . the discount rate is based on the reporting unit 2019s estimated cost of equity capital computed under the capital asset pricing model . embedded in the key assumptions underlying the valuation model , described above , is the inherent uncertainty regarding the possibility that economic conditions may deteriorate or other events will occur that will impact the business model for local consumer lending 2014cards . while there is inherent uncertainty embedded in the assumptions used in developing management 2019s forecasts , the company utilized a discount rate at july 1 , 2010 that it believes reflects the risk characteristics and uncertainty specific to management 2019s forecasts and assumptions for the local consumer lending 2014cards reporting unit . two primary categories of events exist 2014economic conditions in the u.s . and regulatory actions 2014which , if they were to occur , could negatively affect key assumptions used in the valuation of local consumer lending 2014cards . small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations , in particular the discount-rate and growth-rate assumptions used in the net income projections , could significantly affect citigroup 2019s impairment evaluation and , hence , results . if the future were to differ adversely from management 2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions , and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin , citi could potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to $ 4560 million of goodwill remaining in the local consumer lending 2014 cards reporting unit . any such charges , by themselves , would not negatively affect citi 2019s tier 1 and total capital regulatory ratios , tier 1 common ratio , its tangible common equity or citi 2019s liquidity position. .\nquestion:as of december 31, 2010, how much did the goodwill for north america regional consumer banking represent in relation to the one for emea

                "discount rate 2014the assumed discount rate is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations , and represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to effectively settle a plan 2019s benefit obligations . the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate . benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan , but also on the underlying participant demographics , including current age , and assumed mortality . we use only bonds that are denominated in u.s . dollars , rated aa or better by two of three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies , have a minimum outstanding issue of $ 50 million as of the measurement date , and are not callable , convertible , or index linked . since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years , we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point . taking into consideration the factors noted above , our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 5.23% ( 5.23 % ) and 5.84% ( 5.84 % ) , as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 4.94% ( 4.94 % ) and 5.58% ( 5.58 % ) as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . expected long-term rate of return 2014the expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense , and is based on such factors as historical returns , targeted asset allocations , investment policy , duration , expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes , inflation trends , portfolio volatility , and risk management strategies . while studies are helpful in understanding current trends and performance , the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views . in order to reflect expected lower future market returns , we have reduced the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 8.50% ( 8.50 % ) , used to record 2011 expense , to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for 2012 . the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption is primarily related to lower bond yields and updated return assumptions for equities . unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year , the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year . an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions : ( $ in millions ) increase ( decrease ) in 2012 expense increase ( decrease ) in december 31 , 2011 obligations .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>( $ in millions )</td><td>increase ( decrease ) in 2012

might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status . actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income . this unrecognized amount is amortized to the extent it exceeds 10% ( 10 % ) of the greater of the plan 2019s benefit obligation or plan assets . the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants , which is approximately 10 years . cas expense 2014in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs , cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods . while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar , the pattern of cost recognition is different . the key drivers of cas pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption . unlike fas , cas requires the discount rate to be consistent with the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption , which changes infrequently given its long-term nature . as a result , changes in bond or other interest rates generally do not impact cas . in addition , unlike under fas , we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under cas until such plan is fully funded as determined under erisa requirements . other fas and cas considerations 2014we update our estimates of future fas and cas costs at least annually based on factors such as calendar year actual plan asset returns , final census data from the end of the prior year , and other actual and projected experience . a key driver of the difference between fas and cas expense ( and consequently , the fas/cas adjustment ) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements . under fas , our net gains and losses exceeding the 10% ( 10 % ) corridor are amortized .\nquestion:what was the

lower than the aggregate unpaid principal balance as of december 31 , 2008 . for all other non-structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 97 million as of december 31 , 2008 while the aggregate fair value exceeded the aggregate unpaid principal by $ 112 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the change in fair value of these non-structured liabilities reported a gain of $ 1.2 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2008 . the change

on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . certain mortgage loans citigroup has elected the fair-value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held-for- sale . these loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments . the company has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications . the fair-value option was not elected for loans held-for-investment , as those loans are not hedged with derivative instruments . this election was effective for applicable instruments originated or purchased on or after september 1 , 2007 . the following table provides information about certain mortgage loans carried at fair value : in millions of dollars december 31 , december 31 , carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet

excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 2 $ 2014 the changes in fair values of these mortgage loans is reported in other revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . the changes in fair value during the year ended december 31 , 2008 due to instrument- specific credit risk resulted in a $ 32 million loss . the change in fair value during 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk was immaterial . related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . items selected for fair-value accounting in accordance with sfas 155 and sfas 156 certain hybrid financial instruments the company has elected to apply fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for certain hybrid financial assets and liabilities whose performance is linked to risks other than interest rate , foreign exchange or inflation ( e.g. , equity , credit or commodity risks ) . in addition , the company has elected fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for residual interests retained from securitizing certain financial assets . the company has elected fair-value accounting for these instruments because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis . in addition , the accounting for these instruments is simplified under a fair-value approach as it eliminates the complicated operational requirements of bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for each separately . the hybrid financial instruments are classified as trading account assets , loans , deposits , trading account liabilities ( for prepaid derivatives ) , short-term borrowings or long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form , while residual interests in certain securitizations are classified as trading account assets . for hybrid financial instruments for which fair-value accounting has been elected under sfas 155 and that are classified as long-term debt , the aggregate unpaid principal exceeds the aggregate fair value by $ 1.9 billion as of december 31 , 2008 , while the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate unpaid principal balance by $ 460 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the difference for those instruments classified as loans is immaterial . changes in fair value for hybrid financial instruments , which in most cases includes a component for accrued interest , are recorded in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . interest accruals for certain hybrid instruments classified as trading assets are recorded separately from the change in fair value as interest revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . mortgage servicing rights the company accounts for mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value in accordance with sfas 156 . fair value for msrs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach . this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates . the model assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates . the fair value of msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates . in managing this risk , the company hedges a significant portion of the values of its msrs through the use of interest-rate derivative contracts , forward- purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities , and purchased securities classified as trading . see note 23 on page 175 for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs . these msrs , which totaled $ 5.7 billion and $ 8.4 billion as of december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 , respectively , are classified as mortgage servicing rights on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . changes in fair value of msrs are recorded in commissions and fees in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income. .\n<table

liabilities are a result of the company 2019s election of the fair-value option for liabilities associated with the citi-advised structured investment vehicles ( sivs ) , which were consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2007 . the change in fair values of the sivs 2019 liabilities reported in earnings was $ 2.6 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2008 . for these non-structured liabilities the aggregate fair value is $ 263 million lower than the aggregate unpaid principal balance as of december 31 , 2008 . for all other non-structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 97 million as of december 31 , 2008 while the aggregate fair value exceeded the aggregate unpaid principal by $ 112 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the change in fair value of these non-structured liabilities reported a gain of $ 1.2 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2008 . the change in fair value for these non-structured liabilities is reported in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . related interest expense continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . certain mortgage loans citigroup has elected the fair-value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held-for- sale . these loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments . the company has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications . the fair-value option was not elected for loans held-for-investment , as those loans are not hedged with derivative instruments . this election was effective for applicable instruments originated or purchased on or after september 1 , 2007 . the following table provides information about certain mortgage loans carried at fair value : in millions of dollars december 31 , december 31 , carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet $ 4273 $ 6392 aggregate fair value in excess of unpaid principal balance $ 138 $ 136 balance on non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 9 $ 17 aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 2 $ 2014 the changes in fair values of these mortgage loans is reported in other revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . the changes in fair value during the year ended december 31 , 2008 due to instrument- specific credit risk resulted in a $ 32 million loss . the change in fair value during 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk was immaterial . related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . items selected for fair-value accounting in accordance with sfas 155 and sfas 156 certain hybrid financial instruments the company has elected to apply fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for certain hybrid financial assets and liabilities whose performance is linked to risks other than interest rate , foreign exchange or inflation ( e.g. , equity , credit or commodity risks ) . in addition , the company has elected fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for residual interests retained from securitizing certain financial assets . the company has elected fair-value accounting for these instruments because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis . in addition , the accounting for these instruments is simplified under a fair-value approach as it eliminates the complicated operational requirements of bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for each separately . the hybrid financial instruments are classified as trading account assets , loans , deposits , trading account liabilities ( for prepaid derivatives ) , short-term borrowings or long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form , while residual interests in certain securitizations are classified as trading account assets . for hybrid financial instruments for which fair-value accounting has been elected under sfas 155 and that are classified as long-term debt , the aggregate unpaid principal exceeds the aggregate fair value by $ 1.9 billion as of december 31 , 2008 , while the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate unpaid principal balance by $ 460 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the difference for those instruments classified as loans is immaterial . changes in fair value for hybrid financial instruments , which in most cases includes a component for accrued interest , are recorded in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . interest accruals for certain hybrid instruments classified as trading assets are recorded separately from the change in fair value as interest revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . mortgage servicing rights the company accounts for mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value in accordance with sfas 156 . fair value for msrs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach . this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates . the model assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates . the fair value of msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates . in managing this risk , the company hedges a significant portion of the values of its msrs through the use of interest-rate derivative contracts , forward- purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities , and purchased securities classified as trading . see note 23 on page 175 for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs . these msrs , which totaled $ 5.7 billion and $ 8.4 billion as of december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 , respectively , are classified as mortgage servicing rights on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . changes in fair value of msrs are recorded in commissions and fees in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income. .\nquestion:how much do the mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) on the citigroup 2019s ( msrs ) consolidated balance sheet in 2008 represent in

volatility environment in 2017 . in investment banking , industry-wide mergers and acquisitions volumes increased compared with 2017 , while industry-wide underwriting transactions decreased . our other principal transactions revenues benefited from company-specific events , including sales , and strong corporate performance , while investments in public equities reflected losses , as global equity prices generally decreased in 2018 , particularly towards the end of the year . in investment management , our assets under supervision increased reflecting net inflows in liquidity products , fixed income assets and equity assets , partially offset by depreciation in client assets , primarily in equity assets . if market-making or investment banking activity levels decline , or assets under supervision decline , or asset prices continue to decline , net revenues would likely be negatively impacted . see 201csegment operating results 201d for further information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations . during 2017 , generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of industry-wide underwriting activities , investment management performance and other principal transactions . however , low levels of volatility in equity , fixed income , currency and commodity markets continued to negatively affect our market-making activities . 2018 versus 2017 net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 36.62 billion for 2018 , 12% ( 12 % ) higher than 2017 , primarily due

first half of 2017 . guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments in all states , insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund . in most states , in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state , the guaranty funds may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent insurers . assessments are based on each member 2019s proportionate share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged . assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state . some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets , while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process . liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable , when it can be reasonably estimated , and when the event obligating the company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred . liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance- related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets . as of december 31 , 2016 and 2015 the liability balance was $ 134 and $ 138 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2016 and 2015 amounts related to premium tax offsets of $ 34 and $ 44 , respectively , were included in other assets . derivative commitments certain of the company 2019s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings , as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies , of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement . if the legal entity 2019s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings , the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement . the settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement . if the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties , it could impact the legal entity 2019s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity . the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of december 31 , 2016 was $ 1.4 billion . of this $ 1.4 billion , the legal entities have posted collateral of $ 1.7 billion in the normal course of business . in addition , the company has posted collateral of $ 31 associated with a customized gmwb derivative . based on derivative market values as of december 31 , 2016 , a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either moody 2019s or s&p would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral . based on derivative market values as of december 31 , 2016 , a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either moody 2019s or s&p would require additional $ 10 of assets to be posted as collateral . these collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change , as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated . the nature of the collateral that we post , when required , is primarily in the form of u.s . treasury bills , u.s . treasury notes and government agency securities . guarantees in the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties , the company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the company and/or its subsidiaries . these obligations are typically subject to various time limitations , defined by the contract or by operation of law , such as statutes of

                "for fiscal year 2005 , the effective tax rate includes the impact of $ 11.6 million tax expense associated with repatriation of approximately $ 185.0 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . for fiscal year 2004 , the effective tax rate reflects the tax benefit derived from higher earnings in low-tax jurisdictions . during fiscal year 2006 , primarily due to a tax accounting method change , there was a decrease of $ 83.2 million in the current deferred tax assets , and a corresponding increase in non-current deferred tax assets . in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 , we changed our tax accounting method on our tax return for fiscal year 2005 with respect to the current portion of deferred revenue to follow the recognition of revenue under u.s . generally accepted accounting principles . this accounting method change , as well as other adjustments made to our taxable income upon the filing of the fiscal year 2005 tax return , resulted in an increase in our operating loss ( nol ) carryforwards . in may 2006 , the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 was enacted , which provides a three-year exception to current u.s . taxation of certain foreign intercompany income . this provision will first apply to synopsys in fiscal year 2007 . management estimates that had such provisions been applied for fiscal 2006 , our income tax expense would have been reduced by approximately $ 3 million . in december 2006 , the tax relief and health care act of 2006 was enacted , which retroactively extended the research and development credit from january 1 , 2006 . as a result , we will record an expected increase in our fiscal 2006 research and development credit of between $ 1.5 million and $ 1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 . revision of prior year financial statements . as part of our remediation of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting identified in fiscal 2005 relating to accounting for income taxes we implemented additional internal control and review procedures . through such procedures , in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 , we identified four errors totaling $ 8.2 million which affected our income tax provision in fiscal years 2001 through 2005 . we concluded that these errors were not material to any prior year financial statements . although the errors are not material to prior periods , we elected to revise prior year financial statements to correct such errors . the fiscal periods in which the errors originated , and the resulting change in provision ( benefit ) for income taxes for each year , are reflected in the following table : year ended october 31 ( in thousands ) .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>2001</td><td>2002</td><td>2003</td><td>2004</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>$ 205</td><td>$ 1833</td><td>$ 5303</td><td>$ -748 ( 748 )</td><td>$ 1636</td></tr></table>\nthe errors were as follows : ( 1 ) synopsys inadvertently provided a $ 1.4 million tax benefit for the write- off of goodwill relating to an acquisition in fiscal 2002 ; ( 2 ) synopsys did not accrue interest and penalties for certain foreign tax contingency items in the amount of $ 3.2 million ; ( 3 ) synopsys made certain computational errors relating to foreign dividends of $ 2.3 million ; and ( 4 ) synopsys did not record a valuation allowance relating to certain state tax credits of $ 1.3 million . as result of this revision , non-current deferred tax assets decreased by $ 8.1 million and current taxes payable increased by $ 0.2 million . retained earnings decreased by $ 8.2 million and additional paid in capital decreased by $ 0.1 million . see item 9a . controls and procedures for a further discussion of our remediation of the material weakness . tax effects of stock awards . in november 2005 , fasb issued a staff position ( fsp ) on fas 123 ( r ) -3 , transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based payment awards . effective upon issuance , this fsp describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to sfas 123 ( r ) . the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ( apic pool ) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation , and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share-based compensation .\nquestion:what is the provision for income taxes caused by errors in 2003?",

higher membership income from increased plus member penetration at sam's club , these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal 2017 . fiscal 2017 included a $ 535 million gain from the sale of our yihaodian business and a $ 194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in chile . for fiscal 2018 , loss on extinguishment of debt was a0$ 3.1 billion , due to the early extinguishment of

both fiscal 2017 and 2016 . although relatively consistent year-over-year , our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies , valuation allowances , changes in tax laws , outcomes of administrative audits , the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u.s . operations and

for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year . for fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from ecommerce . partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise . for fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables , including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs . operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased 101 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year . fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 included charges related to discontinued real

which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s delegated underwriting and servicing ( dus ) program . we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc . under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement . at december 31 , 2013 and december 31 , 2012 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $ 11.7 billion and $ 12.8 billion , respectively . the potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was $ 3.6 billion at december 31 , 2013 and $

representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements . for additional information on loan sales see note 3 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities . our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc , as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with fha and va-insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal . repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment . in the fourth quarter of 2013 , pnc reached agreements with both fnma and fhlmc to resolve their repurchase claims with respect to loans sold between 2000 and 2008 . pnc paid a total of $ 191 million related to these settlements . pnc 2019s repurchase obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines of credit that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition of national city . pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of loans sold in these transactions . repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/lines of credit is reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment . indemnification and repurchase liabilities are initially recognized when loans are sold to investors and are subsequently evaluated by management . initial recognition and subsequent adjustments to the indemnification and repurchase liability for the sold residential mortgage portfolio are

million . in 2007 , cash flows provided by operating activities increased $ 436 million , including an increase in net income of $ 245 million . since the gain from sale of businesses is included in

pharmaceuticals business are shown as part of cash from investing activities ; however , when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities . thus , operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $ 630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business . non-pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $ 475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments , which benefited cash flows . accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007 , but decreased cash flow less than in 2006 , resulting in a year-on-year benefit to cash flows of $ 323 million . the category 201cother-net 201d in

flows provided by operating activities decreased $ 365 million . this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $ 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 . the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company 2019s repatriation of $ 1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act

however , wood costs are expected to be higher , especially in russia due to strong demand ahead of tariff increases , and energy costs are anticipated to be seasonally higher. .\nquestion:what is the difference in operating earnings from 2006 to 2007?",

actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured . based on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s . treasury and agency securities , municipal securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s . and non-u.s . mortgage- and asset-backed securities . the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time . we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. .\nquestion:what was the average long-term debt in 2014, in billions?",

approximately $ 245 million for the c-5 program due to increased aircraft deliveries ( six aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to four in 2012 ) and other modernization activities ; and about $ 70 million for the f-35 development contract due to increased volume . aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2013 decreased $ 87 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to 2012 . the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $ 85 million for the f-22 program , which includes approximately $ 50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and about $ 35 million due to decreased risk retirements and production volume ; approximately $ 70 million for the c-130 program due to lower risk retirements and fewer deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activities ; about $ 65 million for the c-5 program due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 and lower risk retirements ; approximately $ 35 million for the f-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activity and aircraft configuration mix . the decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 180 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit was comparable for the f-35 development contract and included adjustments of approximately $ 85 million to reflect the inception-to-date impacts of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate in both 2013 and 2012 . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were approximately $ 75 million lower for 2013 compared to backlog backlog decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on f-16 and f-22 programs . backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on f-16 , c-5 and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on the f-35 program . trends we expect aeronautics 2019 2015 net sales to be comparable or slightly behind 2014 due to a decline in f-16 deliveries as well as a decline in f-35 development activity , partially offset by an increase in production contracts . operating profit is also expected to decrease in the low single digit range , due primarily to contract mix , resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between years . information systems & global solutions our is&gs business segment provides advanced technology systems and expertise , integrated information technology solutions and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil , defense , intelligence and other government customers . is&gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments . is&gs has been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agencies 2019 information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price . is&gs 2019 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>2014</td><td>2013</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>net sales</td><td>$ 7788</td><td>$ 8367</td><td>$ 8846</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>operating profit</td><td>699</td><td>759</td><td>808</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>operating margins</td><td>9.0% ( 9.0 % )</td><td>9.1% ( 9.1 % )</td><td>9.1% ( 9.1 % )</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>backlog at year-end</td><td>$ 8700</td><td>$ 8300</td><td>$ 8700</td></tr></table>\n2014 compared to 2013 is&gs 2019 net sales decreased $ 579 million , or 7% ( 7 % ) , for 2014 compared to 2013 . the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of about $ 645 million for 2014 due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs , driven by reductions in direct warfighter support ( including jieddo and ptds ) and defense budgets tied to command and control programs ;

about $ 285 million from f-16 programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries ( 37 f-16 aircraft delivered in 2012 compared to 22 in 2011 ) partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers ;

                "reinvested for continued use in foreign operations . if the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted , a significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the allowable foreign tax credits . it is not practical for us to determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings . in september 2007 , we reached a settlement with the united states department of justice to resolve an investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons . under the terms of the settlement , we paid a civil settlement amount of $ 169.5 million and we recorded an expense in that amount . at the time , no tax benefit was recorded related to the settlement expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax treatment . during the third quarter of 2008 , we reached an agreement with the u.s . internal revenue service ( irs ) confirming the deductibility of a portion of the settlement payment . as a result , during 2008 we recorded a current tax benefit of $ 31.7 million . in june 2006 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued interpretation no . 48 , accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 2013 an interpretation of fasb statement no . 109 , accounting for income taxes ( fin 48 ) . fin 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements . under fin 48 , we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities , based on the technical merits of the position . the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement . fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition , classification , interest and penalties on income taxes , accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures . we adopted fin 48 on january 1 , 2007 . prior to the adoption of fin 48 we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal , state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impact of these expected settlements of $ 102.1 million , as well as a separate accrued interest liability of $ 1.7 million . as a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we are required to present the different components of such liability on a gross basis versus the historical net presentation . the adoption resulted in the financial statement liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by $ 6.4 million as of january 1 , 2007 . the adoption resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a reduction to retained earnings of $ 4.8 million , a reduction in goodwill of $ 61.4 million , the establishment of a tax receivable of $ 58.2 million , which was recorded in other current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet , and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of $ 7.9 million , all as of january 1 , 2007 . therefore , after the adoption of fin 48 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 95.7 million as of january 1 , 2007 . as of december 31 , 2008 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 129.5 million . of this amount , $ 45.5 million would impact our effective tax rate if recognized . $ 38.2 million of the $ 129.5 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by us . under fas 141 ( r ) , if these liabilities are settled for different amounts , they will affect the income tax expense in the period of reversal or settlement . the following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits ( in millions ) : .\n<table

accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings , which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods . as of december 31 , 2007 , we recorded a liability of $ 19.6 million for accrued interest and penalties , of which $ 14.7 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . the amount of this liability is $ 22.9 million as of december 31 , 2008 . of this amount , $ 17.1 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . we expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months ; however , we do not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position . the u.s . federal statute of limitations remains open for the year 2003 and onward . the u.s . federal returns for years 2003 and 2004 are currently under examination by the irs . on july 15 , 2008 , the irs issued its examination report . we filed a formal protest on august 15 , 2008 and requested a conference with the appeals office regarding disputed issues . although the appeals process could take several years , we do not anticipate resolution of the audit will result in any significant impact on our results of operations , financial position or cash flows . in addition , for the 1999 tax year of centerpulse , which we acquired in october 2003 , one issue remains in dispute . state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective return . the state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states . we have various state income tax returns in the process of examination , administrative appeals or litigation . it is z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c . 2 0 0 8 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p

accordingly , the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test , except for the test performed as of december 31 , 2008 . as of december 31 , 2008 , there was an indication of impairment in the north america consumer banking , latin america consumer banking and emea consumer banking reporting units and , accordingly , the second step of testing was performed on these reporting units . based on the results of the second step of testing , the company recorded a $ 9.6 billion pretax ( $ 8.7 billion after tax ) goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 , representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units . the primary cause for the goodwill impairment in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial markets , as well as in the global economic outlook particularly during the period beginning mid-november through year end 2008 . this deterioration further weakened the near-term prospects for the financial services industry . these and other factors , including the increased possibility of further government intervention , also resulted in the decline in the company 2019s market capitalization from approximately $ 90 billion at july 1 , 2008 and approximately $ 74 billion at october 31 , 2008 to approximately $ 36 billion at december 31 , 2008 . the more significant fair-value adjustments in the pro forma purchase price allocation in the second step of testing were to fair-value loans and debt and were made to identify and value identifiable intangibles . the adjustments to measure the assets , liabilities and intangibles were for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet . the following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances and the excess of fair value of allocated book value as of december 31 , 2008 . reporting unit ( $ in millions ) fair value as a % (  % ) of allocated book value goodwill ( post-impairment ) .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>reporting unit ( $ inmillions )</td><td>fair value as a % (  % ) of allocated book

impairment test at october 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2008 , goodwill present in that reporting unit may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions . under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit , the earnings multiples and transaction multiples were selected from multiples obtained using data from guideline companies and acquisitions . the selection of the actual multiple considers operating performance and financial condition such as return on equity and net income growth of securities and banking as compared to the guideline companies and acquisitions . for the valuation under the income approach , the company utilized a discount rate which it believes reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the projected cash flows , and selected 2013 as the terminal year . in 2013 , the value was derived assuming a return to historical levels of core-business profitability for the reporting unit , despite the significant losses experienced in 2008 . this assumption is based on management 2019s view that this recovery will occur based upon various macro- economic factors such as the recent u.s . government stimulus actions , restoring marketplace confidence and improved risk-management practices on an industry-wide basis . furthermore , company-specific actions such as its recently announced realignment of its businesses to optimize its global businesses for future profitable growth , will also be a factor in returning the company 2019s core securities and banking business to historical levels . small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations , in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the net income projections , could significantly affect the company 2019s impairment evaluation and , hence , results . if the future were to differ adversely from management 2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin , the company could potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to the goodwill remaining in our securities and banking reporting unit . any such charges by themselves would not negatively affect the company 2019s tier 1 and total regulatory capital ratios , tangible capital or the company 2019s liquidity position. .\nquestion:what was the goodwill impairment charge in

a0million of trust preferred securities , which are reflected on the balance sheet as junior subordinate deferrable interest debentures . the proceeds were used to repay our revolving credit facility . the $ 100.0 a0million of junior subordi- nate deferrable interest debentures have a 30-year term ending july 2035 . they bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.61% ( 5.61 % ) for the first 10 years ending july 2015 . thereafter , the rate will float at three month libor plus 1.25% ( 1.25 % ) . the securities are redeemable at par . restrictive covenants the terms of the 2011 revolving credit facility and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit , among other things , our ability to pay dividends ( as discussed below ) , make certain types of investments , incur additional indebtedness , incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and the disposition of assets , and which require compliance with financial ratios including our minimum tangible net worth , a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value , a minimum ratio of ebitda to fixed charges and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value . the dividend restriction referred to above provides that we will not during any time when we are in default , make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests , except to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes . as of december a031 , 2011 and 2010 , we were in compli- ance with all such covenants . market rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements . we use interest rate deriv- ative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes . a a0hypothetical 100 a0basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for 2011 and 2010 , would increase our annual interest cost by approximately $ 12.3 a0million and $ 11.0 a0mil- lion and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by approximately $ 4.8 a0million and $ 6.7 a0million , respectively . we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value . derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income . if a derivative is a hedge , depending on the nature of the hedge , changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset , liability , or firm commitment through earnings , or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings . the ineffective portion of a derivative 2019s change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings . approximately $ 4.8 a0billion of our long- term debt bore interest a0at fixed rates , and therefore the fair value of these instru- ments is affected by changes in the market interest rates . the interest rate on our variable rate debt and joint venture debt as of december a031 , 2011 ranged from libor plus 150 a0basis points to libor plus 350 a0basis points . contractual obligations combined aggregate principal maturities of mortgages and other

rates , foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items . from time to time , we use derivative instruments , pursuant to established guidelines and policies , to manage some portion of these risks . derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes . interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations . the majority of our debt ( approximately 93% ( 93 % ) and 89% ( 89 % ) as of december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively ) bears interest at fixed rates . we do have debt with variable interest rates , but a 10% ( 10 % ) increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows . the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates , and the impact of a 10% ( 10 % ) change in interest rates is summarized below .

for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates . we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 , 2016 . we had $ 1100.6 of cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 , 2016 that we generally invest in conservative , short-term bank deposits or securities . the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements . during 2016 and 2015 , we had interest income of $ 20.1 and $ 22.8 , respectively . based on our 2016 results , a 100 basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $ 11.0 , assuming that all cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2016 levels . foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates . since we report revenues and expenses in u.s . dollars , changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses ( as expressed in u.s . dollars ) from foreign operations . the foreign currencies that most impacted our results during 2016 included the british pound sterling and , to a lesser extent , the argentine peso , brazilian real and japanese yen . based on 2016 exchange rates and operating results , if the u.s . dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10% ( 10 % ) , we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% ( 4 % ) , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2016 levels . the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency . assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date , and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented . the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss , net of tax , in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets . our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency , mitigating transaction risk . however , certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency . assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement . currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses . we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures . we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. .\nquestion:what was the interest income in 2016?",

the 2009 plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options , long-term performance awards in the form of performance shares or units , restricted stock , rsus and stock appreciation rights . the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors determines the grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation plans . the date for annual grants under the 2009 plan to our executive officers is expected to occur in the first quarter of each year following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year . the

exercise of stock options from previously unissued shares , except in limited circumstances where they are issued from treasury stock . the total number of awards which may be granted in a given year

higher than 2011 . these results reflected strong net revenues in mortgages , which were significantly higher compared with 2011 . in addition , net revenues in credit products and interest rate products were solid and higher compared with 2011 . these increases were partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in commodities and slightly lower net revenues in currencies . although broad market concerns persisted during 2012 , fixed income , currency and commodities client execution operated in a generally improved environment characterized by tighter credit spreads and less challenging market-making conditions compared with 2011 . net revenues in equities were $ 8.21 billion for 2012 , essentially unchanged compared with 2011 . net revenues in securities services were significantly higher compared with 2011 , reflecting a gain of approximately $ 500 million on the sale of our hedge fund administration business . in addition , equities client execution net revenues were higher than 2011 , primarily reflecting significantly higher results in cash products , principally due to increased levels of client activity . these increases were offset by lower commissions and fees , reflecting lower market volumes . during 2012 , equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels . the net loss attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $ 714 million ( $ 433 million and $ 281 million related to fixed income ,

, currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2011 . during 2012 , institutional client services operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad market concerns and uncertainties , although positive developments helped to improve market conditions . these developments included certain central bank actions to ease monetary policy and address funding risks for european financial institutions . in addition , the u.s . economy posted stable to improving economic data , including favorable developments in unemployment and housing . these improvements resulted in tighter credit spreads , higher global equity prices and lower levels of volatility . however , concerns about the outlook for the global economy and continued political uncertainty , particularly the political debate in the united states surrounding the fiscal cliff , generally resulted in client risk aversion and lower activity levels . also , uncertainty over financial regulatory reform persisted . if these concerns and uncertainties continue over the long term , net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities would likely be negatively impacted . operating expenses were $ 12.48 billion for 2012 , 3% ( 3 % ) lower than 2011 , primarily due to lower brokerage , clearing , exchange and distribution fees , and lower impairment charges , partially offset by higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings . pre-tax earnings were $ 5.64 billion in 2012 , 27% ( 27 % ) higher than 2011 . 2011

environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty , resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads , which contributed to

october 2016 and june 2018 , respectively . eletropaulo 2014 in november 2017 , eletropaulo converted its preferred shares into ordinary shares and transitioned the listing of those shares to the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares , aes no longer controlled eletropaulo , but maintained significant influence over the business . as a result , the company deconsolidated eletropaulo . after deconsolidation , the company's 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest was reflected as an equity method investment . the company recorded an after-tax loss on deconsolidation of $ 611 million , which primarily consisted of $ 455 million related to cumulative translation losses and $ 243 million related to pension losses reclassified from aocl . in december 2017 , all the remaining criteria were met for eletropaulo to qualify as a discontinued operation . therefore , its results of operations and financial position were reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . in june 2018 , the company completed the sale of its entire 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest in eletropaulo through a bidding process hosted by the brazilian securities regulator , cvm . gross proceeds of $ 340 million were received at our subsidiary in brazil , subject to the payment of taxes . upon disposal of eletropaulo , the company recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $ 243 million ( after-tax $ 199 million ) . excluding the gain on sale , eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes was immaterial for the year ended december 31 , 2018 . eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes , including the loss on deconsolidation , for the years ended december 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 633 million and $ 192 million , respectively . prior to its classification as discontinued operations , eletropaulo was reported in the south america sbu

discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after-tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for

the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements . refer to note 17 , commitments and contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information . due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing , we excluded the potential payments from the contractual obligations table . pension

u.k . pension plan 2014were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans . over the long run , the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions . for 2013 , the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $ 3800.8 from $ 3239.1 in 2012 . the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $ 4394.0 and $ 4486.5 in 2013 and 2012 , respectively . refer to note 16 , retirement benefits , to the

vs . 2012 the increase in pension expense , excluding special items , was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate , resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses . the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013 . special items of $ 19.8 primarily included $ 12.4 for pension settlement losses and $ 6.9 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan . 2012 vs . 2011 pension expense in 2012 , excluding special items , was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year . 2014 outlook pension expense is estimated to be approximately $ 140 to $ 145 , excluding special items , in 2014 , a decrease of $ 5 to $ 10 from 2013 , resulting primarily from an increase in discount rates , partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality and inflation assumptions . pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 25 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements . in 2014 , pension expense will include approximately $ 118 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $ 143 in 2013 . net actuarial gains of $ 370.4 were recognized in 2013 , resulting primarily from an approximately 65 bp increase in the weighted average discount rate as well as actual asset returns above expected returns . actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses . future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets , different from expected returns , would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2014 . pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans . with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses . in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions . with the assistance of third party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions . during 2013 and 2012 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 300.8 and $ 76.4 , respectively . contributions for 2013 include voluntary contributions for u.s . plans of $ 220.0. .\nquestion:what was the difference of cash contributions to funded

comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments , the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs . the following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note 5 to the financial statements . we have a number of programs that are classified by the u.s . government and cannot be specifically described . the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results , and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs . aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research , design , development , manufacture , integration , sustainment , support , and upgrade of advanced military aircraft , including combat and air mobility aircraft , unmanned air vehicles , and related technologies . key combat aircraft programs include the f-35 lightning ii , f-16 fighting falcon , and f-22 raptor fighter aircraft . key air mobility programs include the c-130j super hercules and the c-5m super galaxy . aeronautics provides logistics support , sustainment , and upgrade modification services for its aircraft . aeronautics 2019

during the year . the $ 800 million increase in air mobility primarily was attributable to higher volume on c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities , as well as higher volume on the c-5 reliability enhancement and re-engining program ( rerp ) . there were 25 c-130j deliveries in 2010 compared to 16 in 2009 . the $ 179 million increase in combat aircraft principally was due to higher volume on f-35 production contracts , which partially was offset by lower volume on the f-35 sdd contract and a decline in volume on f-16 , f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 20 f-16 deliveries in 2010 compared to 31 in 2009 . the $ 55 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by a decline in volume on sustainment activities . net sales for aeronautics increased by 6% ( 6 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales increased in all three lines of business . the increase of $ 296 million in air mobility 2019s sales primarily was attributable to higher volume on the c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities . there were 16 c-130j deliveries in 2009 and 12 in 2008 . combat aircraft sales increased $ 316 million principally due to higher volume on the f-35 program and increases in f-16 deliveries , which partially were offset by lower volume on f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 31 f-16 deliveries in 2009 compared to 28 in 2008 . the $ 116 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 programs and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by declines in sustainment activities . operating profit for the segment decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . a decline in operating profit in combat aircraft partially was offset by increases in other aeronautics programs and air mobility . the $ 149 million decrease in combat aircraft 2019s operating profit primarily was due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the f-22 program , the f-35 sdd contract and f-16 and other combat aircraft programs in 2010 . these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on f-35 production contracts in 2010 . the $ 35 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on p-3 and advanced development programs as well as an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on sustainment activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in air mobility operating profit primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance in 2010 on c-130j support activities , which more than offset a decrease in operating profit due to a lower level of favorable performance adjustments on c-130j deliveries in 2010 . the remaining change in operating profit is attributable to an increase in other income , net between the comparable periods . aeronautics 2019 2010 operating margins have decreased when compared to 2009 . the operating margin decrease reflects the life cycles of our significant programs . specifically , aeronautics is performing more development and initial production work on the f-35 program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the f-22 and f-16 . development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs . accordingly , while net sales increased in 2010

additional interest expense related to the short-term debt used to finance the acquisition . these adjustments assume the application of fair value adjustments to intangibles and the debt issuance occurred on january 1 , 2015 and are approximated as follows : amortization expense of $ 125million and interest expense of $ 40million . in addition , significant nonrecurring adjustments include the elimination of a $ 72million pension curtailment loss , net of tax , recognized in 2015 and the elimination of a $ 58 million income tax charge related to historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries recognized by sikorsky in 2015 . the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also reflects an increase in interest expense , net of tax , of approximately $ 110 million in 2015 . the increase in interest expense is the result of assuming the november 2015 notes were issued on january 1 , 2015 . proceeds of the november 2015 notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364- day facility used to finance a portion of the purchase price of sikorsky , as contemplated at the date of acquisition . the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information does not reflect the realization of any expected ongoing cost or revenue synergies relating to the integration of the two companies . further , the pro forma data should not be considered indicative of the

relationships , $ 32 million of net liabilities , and noncontrolling interests of $ 107 million . the intangible assets are being amortized over a period of eight years in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows . in 2016we recognized a non-cash net gain of $ 104million associatedwith obtaining a controlling interest inawewhich consisted of a $ 127 million pretax gain recognized in the operating results of our space business segment and $ 23 million of tax-related items at our corporate office . the gain represents the fair value of our 51% ( 51 % ) interest inawe , less the carrying value of our previously held investment inawe and deferred taxes . the gainwas recorded in other income , net on our consolidated statements of earnings . the fair value ofawe ( including the intangible assets ) , our controlling interest , and the noncontrolling interests were determined using the income approach . divestiture

                "interest-earning assets including unearned income in the accretion of fair value adjustments on discounts recognized on acquired or purchased loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument . the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates , judgments , assumptions , and interpretation of contractual terms . changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products , market conditions or industry norms . residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights we elect to measure our residential mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value . this election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets as described below . the fair value of residential msrs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows , taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates , discount rates , servicing costs , and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions . assumptions incorporated into the residential msrs valuation model reflect management 2019s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the residential msrs . although sales of residential msrs do occur , residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available . as a benchmark for the reasonableness of its residential msrs fair value , pnc obtains opinions of value from independent parties ( 201cbrokers 201d ) . these brokers provided a range ( +/- 10 bps ) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflected conditions in the secondary market , and any recently executed servicing transactions . pnc compares its internally-developed residential msrs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers . if our residential msrs fair value falls outside of the brokers 2019 ranges , management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted . for 2011 and 2010 , pnc 2019s residential msrs value has not fallen outside of the brokers 2019 ranges . we consider our residential msrs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value . commercial msrs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained . commercial msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available . commercial msrs are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value . commercial msrs are periodically evaluated for impairment . for purposes of impairment , the commercial mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on asset type , which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset . the fair value of commercial msrs is estimated by using an internal valuation model . the model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows considering estimates of servicing revenue and costs , discount rates and prepayment speeds . pnc employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors . residential msrs values are economically hedged with securities and derivatives , including interest-rate swaps , options , and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts . as interest rates change , these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential msrs portfolio . the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential msrs assets . commercial msrs are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives to protect against a significant decline in interest rates . selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of msrs . hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term , but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the msrs . the fair value of residential and commercial msrs and significant inputs to the valuation model as of december 31 , 2011 are shown in the tables below . the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value . management uses a third-party model to estimate future residential loan prepayments and internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial loan prepayments . these models have been refined based on current market conditions . future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of msrs . management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates . the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for u.s . dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments . changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate . residential mortgage servicing rights dollars in millions

reinsurance of $ 1.08 billion , $ 880 million and $ 827 million for the years ended december 2012 , december 2011 and december 2010 , respectively . 2012 versus 2011 . net revenues in institutional client services were $ 18.12 billion for 2012 , 5% ( 5 % ) higher than 2011 . net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were $ 9.91 billion for 2012 , 10% ( 10 % ) higher than 2011 . these results reflected strong net revenues in mortgages , which were significantly higher compared with 2011 . in addition , net revenues in credit products and interest rate products were solid and higher compared with 2011 . these increases were partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in commodities and slightly lower net revenues in currencies . although broad market concerns persisted during 2012 , fixed income , currency and commodities client execution operated in a generally improved environment characterized by tighter credit spreads and less challenging market-making conditions compared with 2011 . net revenues in equities were $ 8.21 billion for 2012 , essentially unchanged compared with 2011 . net revenues in securities services were significantly higher compared with 2011 , reflecting a gain of approximately $ 500 million on the sale of our hedge fund administration business . in addition , equities client execution net revenues were higher than 2011 , primarily reflecting significantly higher results in cash products , principally due to increased levels of client activity . these increases were offset by lower commissions and fees , reflecting lower market volumes . during 2012 , equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels . the net loss attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $ 714 million ( $ 433 million and $ 281 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2012 , compared with a net gain of $ 596 million ( $ 399 million and $ 197 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2011 . during 2012 , institutional client services operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad market concerns and uncertainties , although positive developments helped to improve market conditions . these developments included certain central bank actions to ease monetary policy and address funding risks for european financial institutions . in addition , the u.s . economy posted stable to improving economic data , including favorable developments in unemployment and housing . these improvements resulted in tighter credit spreads , higher global equity prices and lower levels of volatility . however , concerns about the outlook for the global economy and continued political uncertainty , particularly the political debate in the united states surrounding the fiscal cliff , generally resulted in client risk aversion and lower activity levels . also , uncertainty over financial regulatory reform persisted . if these concerns and uncertainties continue over the long term , net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities would likely be negatively impacted . operating expenses were $ 12.48 billion for 2012 , 3% ( 3 % ) lower than 2011 , primarily due to lower brokerage , clearing , exchange and distribution fees , and lower impairment charges , partially offset by higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings . pre-tax earnings were $ 5.64 billion in 2012 , 27% ( 27 % ) higher than 2011 . 2011 versus 2010 . net revenues in institutional client services were $ 17.28 billion for 2011 , 21% ( 21 % ) lower than 2010 . net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were $ 9.02 billion for 2011 , 34% ( 34 % ) lower than 2010 . although activity levels during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels , and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011 , the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty , resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads , which contributed to difficult market-making conditions and led to reductions in risk by us and our clients . as a result of these conditions , net revenues across the franchise were lower , including significant declines

                "development of prior year incurred losses was $ 135.6 million unfavorable in 2006 , $ 26.4 million favorable in 2005 and $ 249.4 million unfavorable in 2004 . such losses were the result of the reserve development noted above , as well as inher- ent uncertainty in establishing loss and lae reserves . reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expenses as of year end 2006 , 7.4% ( 7.4 % ) of reserves reflect an estimate for the company 2019s ultimate liability for a&e claims for which ulti- mate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques . the company 2019s a&e liabilities stem from mt . mckinley 2019s direct insurance business and everest re 2019s assumed reinsurance business . there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company 2019s potential losses from a&e claims . see item 7 , 201cmanagement 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 2014asbestos and environmental exposures 201d and note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements . mt . mckinley 2019s book of direct a&e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous . it also arises from a limited period , effective 1978 to 1984 . the book is based principally on excess liability policies , thereby limiting exposure analysis to a lim- ited number of policies and forms . as a result of this focused structure , the company believes that it is able to comprehen- sively analyze its exposures , allowing it to identify , analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure , including policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products asbestos claims . the company endeavors to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt . mckinley . such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement , negotiation , litigation , or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place ( 201csip 201d ) agreements . sip agreements generally condition an insurer 2019s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer 2019s payments . the company 2019s mt . mckinley operation is currently managing eight sip agreements , three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt . mckinley in 2000 . the company 2019s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to exe- cute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments , because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty . the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time , as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active . those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous , but still active management , with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics , which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity . the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders , including those that may not have reported significant a&e losses . everest re 2019s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a&e exposed relationships . it also arises from a limited period , effectively 1977 to 1984 . because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a&e exposures for many years , its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities . the company 2019s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies . this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company 2019s analysis of its exposure through those companies . as a result , the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure , such as non-products asbestos claims , for concentrated attention . however , in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities , the company relies on claims data supplied , both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers . this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeli- ness of the company 2019s ultimate loss projections . the following table summarizes the composition of the company 2019s total reserves for a&e losses , gross and net of reinsurance , for the years ended december 31:

under two stock option plans : the ppg industries , inc . stock plan ( 201cppg stock plan 201d ) and the ppg omnibus plan . under the ppg omnibus plan and the ppg stock plan , certain employees of the company have been granted options to purchase shares of common stock at prices equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date the options were granted . the options are generally exercisable beginning from six to 48 months after being granted and have a maximum term of 10 years . upon exercise of a stock option , shares of company stock are issued from treasury stock . the ppg stock plan includes a restored option provision for options originally granted prior to january 1 , 2003 that allows an optionee to exercise options and satisfy the option price by certifying ownership of mature shares of ppg common stock with equivalent market value . the fair value of stock options issued to employees is measured on the date of grant and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period . ppg estimates the fair value of stock options using the black-scholes option pricing model . the risk-free interest rate is determined by using the u.s . treasury yield curve at the date of the grant and using a maturity equal to the expected life of the option . the expected life of options is calculated using the average of the vesting term and the maximum term , as prescribed by accounting guidance on the use of the simplified method for determining the expected term of an employee share option . this method is used as the vesting term of stock options was changed to three years in 2004 and , as a result , the historical exercise data does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life of options . the expected dividend yield and volatility are based on historical stock prices and dividend amounts over past time periods equal in length to the expected life of the options . 66 2010 ppg annual report and form 10-k .\nquestion:in 2010, what

outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance , including industry-specific guidance . the guidance also changes the accounting for certain contract costs and revises the criteria for determining if an entity is acting as a principal or agent in certain arrangements . the key changes in the standard that impact the company 2019s revenue recognition relate to the presentation of certain revenue contracts and associated contract costs . the most significant of these changes relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs , which are currently presented net against revenues ( contra-revenue ) and will be presented as an expense on a

2011 . revenue growth of 8 percent and a decline in the provision for credit losses were more than offset by a 16 percent increase in noninterest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 . further detail is included in the net interest income , noninterest income , provision for credit losses and noninterest expense portions of this consolidated income statement review . net interest income table 2 : net

3.92 % )</td></tr></table>\nchanges in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields , interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid , and noninterest-bearing sources of funding . see the statistical information ( unaudited ) 2013 average consolidated balance sheet and net interest analysis and analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income in item 8 of this report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion of purchased impaired loans in the consolidated balance sheet review in this item 7 for additional information . the increase in net interest income in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition , organic loan growth and lower funding costs . purchase accounting accretion remained stable at $ 1.1 billion in both periods . the net interest margin was 3.94% ( 3.94 % ) for 2012 and 3.92% ( 3.92 % ) for 2011 . the increase in the comparison was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average rate accrued on total interest- bearing liabilities of 29 basis points , largely offset by a 21 basis point decrease on the yield on total interest-earning assets . the decrease in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the runoff of maturing retail certificates of deposit and the redemption of additional trust preferred and hybrid capital securities during 2012 , in addition to an increase in fhlb borrowings and commercial paper as lower-cost funding sources . the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to lower rates on new loan volume and lower yields on new securities in the current low rate environment . with respect to the first quarter of 2013 , we expect net interest income to decline by two to three percent compared to fourth quarter 2012 net interest income of $ 2.4 billion , due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion of up to $ 50 to $ 60 million , including lower expected cash recoveries . for the full year 2013 , we expect net interest income to decrease compared with 2012 , assuming an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion of approximately $ 400 million , while core net interest income is expected to increase in the year-over-year comparison . we believe our net interest margin will come under pressure in 2013 , due to the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion and assuming that the current low rate environment continues . noninterest income noninterest income totaled $ 5.9 billion for 2012 and $ 5.6 billion for 2011 . the overall increase in the comparison was primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume , gains on sales of visa class b common shares and higher corporate service fees , largely offset by higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations . asset management revenue , including blackrock , totaled $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 . this increase was primarily due to higher earnings from our blackrock investment . discretionary assets under management increased to $ 112 billion at december 31 , 2012 compared with $ 107 billion at december 31 , 2011 driven by stronger average equity markets , positive net flows and strong sales performance . for 2012 , consumer services fees were $ 1.1 billion compared with $ 1.2 billion in 2011 . the decline reflected the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions partially offset by customer growth . as further discussed in the retail banking portion of the business segments review section of this item 7 , the dodd-frank limits on interchange rates were effective october 1 , 2011 and had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $ 314 million in 2012 and $ 75 million in 2011 . this impact was partially offset by higher volumes of merchant , customer credit card and debit card transactions and the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition . corporate services revenue increased by $ .3 billion , or 30 percent , to $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ .9 billion in 2011 due to higher commercial mortgage servicing revenue and higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in 2012 . the major components of corporate services revenue are treasury management revenue , corporate finance fees , including revenue from capital markets-related products and services , and commercial mortgage servicing revenue , including commercial mortgage banking activities . see the product revenue portion of this consolidated income statement review for further detail . the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 39

                "discount rate 2014the assumed discount rate is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations , and represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to effectively settle a plan 2019s benefit obligations . the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate . benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan , but also on the underlying participant demographics , including current age , and assumed mortality . we use only bonds that are denominated in u.s . dollars , rated aa or better by two of three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies , have a minimum outstanding issue of $ 50 million as of the measurement date , and are not callable , convertible , or index linked . since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years , we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point . taking into consideration the factors noted above , our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 5.23% ( 5.23 % ) and 5.84% ( 5.84 % ) , as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 4.94% ( 4.94 % ) and 5.58% ( 5.58 % ) as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . expected long-term rate of return 2014the expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense , and is based on such factors as historical returns , targeted asset allocations , investment policy , duration , expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes , inflation trends , portfolio volatility , and risk management strategies . while studies are helpful in understanding current trends and performance , the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views . in order to reflect expected lower future market returns , we have reduced the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 8.50% ( 8.50 % ) , used to record 2011 expense , to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for 2012 . the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption is primarily related to lower bond yields and updated return assumptions for equities . unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year , the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year . an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions : ( $ in millions ) increase ( decrease ) in 2012 expense increase ( decrease ) in december 31 , 2011 obligations .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>( $ in millions )</td><td>increase ( decrease ) in 2012

might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status . actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income . this unrecognized amount is amortized to the extent it exceeds 10% ( 10 % ) of the greater of the plan 2019s benefit obligation or plan assets . the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants , which is approximately 10 years . cas expense 2014in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs , cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods . while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar , the pattern of cost recognition is different . the key drivers of cas pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption . unlike fas , cas requires the discount rate to be consistent with the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption , which changes infrequently given its long-term nature . as a result , changes in bond or other interest rates generally do not impact cas . in addition , unlike under fas , we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under cas until such plan is fully funded as determined under erisa requirements . other fas and cas considerations 2014we update our estimates of future fas and cas costs at least annually based on factors such as calendar year actual plan asset returns , final census data from the end of the prior year , and other actual and projected experience . a key driver of the difference between fas and cas expense ( and consequently , the fas/cas adjustment ) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements . under fas , our net gains and losses exceeding the 10% ( 10 % ) corridor are amortized .\nquestion:what was the

outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance , including industry-specific guidance . the guidance also changes the accounting for certain contract costs and revises the criteria for determining if an entity is acting as a principal or agent in certain arrangements . the key changes in the standard that impact the company 2019s revenue recognition relate to the presentation of certain revenue contracts and associated contract costs . the most significant of these changes relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs , which are currently presented net against revenues ( contra-revenue ) and will be presented as an expense on a gross basis . the company adopted asu 2014-09 effective january 1 , 2018 on a full retrospective basis , which will require 2016 and 2017 to be restated in future filings . the cumulative effect adjustment to the 2016 opening retained earnings was not material . the company currently expects the net gross up to revenue to be approximately $ 1 billion with a corresponding gross up to expense

fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum . at december 31 , 2017 , the majority of the company 2019s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end aum of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts . movements in equity market prices , interest rates/credit spreads , foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline , which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees . corporate investments portfolio risks . as a leading investment management firm , blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying , measuring , monitoring , managing and analyzing market and operating risks , including the management and oversight of its own investment

however , raw material costs are expected to continue to increase , primarily for wood and energy . brazil ian papers net sales for 2007 of $ 850 mil- lion were higher than the $ 495 million in 2006 and the $ 465 million in 2005 . compared with 2006 , aver- age sales price realizations improved reflecting price increases for uncoated freesheet paper realized dur- ing the second half of 2006 and the first half of 2007 . excluding the impact of the luiz antonio acquisition , sales volumes increased primarily for cut size and offset paper . operating profits for 2007 of $ 246 mil- lion were up from $ 122 million in 2006 and $ 134 mil- lion in 2005 as the benefits from higher sales prices and favorable manufacturing costs were only parti- ally offset by higher input costs . contributions from the luiz antonio acquisition increased net sales by approximately $ 350 million and earnings by approx- imately $ 80 million in 2007 . entering 2008 , sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper and pulp should be seasonally lower . average price realizations should be essentially flat , but mar- gins are expected to reflect a less favorable product mix . energy costs , primarily for hydroelectric power , are expected to increase significantly reflecting a lack of rainfall in brazil in the latter part of 2007 . european papers net sales in 2007 were $ 1.5 bil- lion compared with $ 1.3 billion in 2006 and $ 1.2 bil- lion in 2005 . sales volumes in 2007 were higher than in 2006 at our eastern european mills reflecting stronger market demand and improved efficiencies , but lower in western europe reflecting the closure of the marasquel mill in 2006 . average sales price real- izations increased significantly in 2007 in both east- ern and western european markets . operating profits of $ 214 million in 2007 increased from a loss of $ 16 million in 2006 and earnings of $ 88 million in 2005 . the loss in 2006 reflects the impact of a $ 128 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the saillat , france mill . excluding this charge , the improvement in 2007 compared with 2006 reflects the contribution from higher net sales , partially offset by higher input costs for wood , energy and freight . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to be stable in western europe , but seasonally weaker in eastern europe and russia . average price realizations are expected to remain about flat . wood costs are expected to increase , especially in russia due to strong demand ahead of tariff increases , and energy costs are anticipated to be seasonally higher . asian printing papers net sales were approx- imately $ 20 million in 2007 , compared with $ 15 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 10 million in 2005 . operating earnings increased slightly in 2007 , but were close to breakeven in all periods . u.s . market pulp sales in 2007 totaled $ 655 mil- lion compared with $ 510 million and $ 525 million in 2006 and 2005 , respectively . sales volumes in 2007 were up from 2006 levels , primarily for paper and .\nquestion:what were asian paper net sales in 2007?",

2022 relative market position ; 2022 strong risk management ; 2022 strong capital ratios ; 2022 diverse liquidity sources , including the global capital markets and client deposits ; 2022 strong liquidity monitoring procedures ; and 2022 preparedness for current or future regulatory developments . high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by : 2022 providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors ; 2022 increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products ; 2022 serving markets ; and 2022 engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings . a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets , which could increase the related cost of funds . in turn , this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients , which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments ; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts . a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings . we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies . the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 , financial statements and supplementary data , of this form 10-k . other funding sources , such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements , for which there are no explicit triggers , could also be adversely affected. .\nquestion:as of december 31, 2017, what was the value of cad equivalent to one american dollar?",

of nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock price on the date of grant . the value of certain incentive/ performance unit share awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals generally over a three-year period . the personnel and compensation committee of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to incentive/performance unit share awards . restricted stock/unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 36 months to 60 months . beginning in 2012 , we incorporated several risk-related performance changes to certain incentive compensation programs . in addition to achieving certain financial performance metrics relative to our peers , the final payout amount will be subject to a negative adjustment if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreement . however , the p&cc has the discretion to reduce any or all of this negative adjustment under certain circumstances . these awards

) the weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 4.2 years . at december 31 , 2007 , there were approximately 13788000 options in total that were vested and are expected to vest . the weighted-average exercise price of such options was $ 62.07 per share , the weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 5.2 years , and the aggregate intrinsic value at december 31 , 2007 was approximately $ 92 million . stock options granted in 2005 include options for 30000 shares that were granted to non-employee directors that year . no such options were granted in 2006 or 2007 . awards granted to non-employee directors in 2007 include 20944 deferred stock units awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan . a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which requires liability accounting treatment under sfas 123r until such awards are paid to the participants as cash . as there are no vestings or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full on all awarded units on the date of grant . the weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was $ 11.37 , $ 10.75 and $ 9.83 per option , respectively . to determine stock-based compensation expense under sfas 123r , the grant-date fair value is applied to the options granted with a reduction made for estimated forfeitures . at december 31 , 2006 and 2005 options for 10743000 and 13582000 shares of common stock , respectively , were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 58.38 and $ 56.58 , respectively . the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was $ 52 million , $ 111 million and $ 31 million , respectively . at december 31 , 2007 the aggregate intrinsic value of all options outstanding and exercisable was $ 94 million and $ 87 million , respectively . cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was approximately $ 111 million , $ 233 million and $ 98 million , respectively . the actual tax benefit realized for tax deduction purposes from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was approximately $ 39 million , $ 82 million and $ 34 million , respectively . there were no options granted in excess of market value in 2007 , 2006 or 2005 . shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the incentive plans were 40116726 at december 31 , 2007 . total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 41787400 shares at december 31 , 2007 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans , the employee stock purchase plan as described below , and a director plan . during 2007 , we issued approximately 2.1 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity . as with past exercise activity , we intend to utilize treasury stock for future stock option exercises . as discussed in note 1 accounting policies , we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 prospectively to all employee awards including stock options granted , modified or settled after january 1 , 2003 . as permitted under sfas 123 , we recognized compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the pro rata vesting period . total compensation expense recognized related to pnc stock options in 2007 was $ 29 million compared with $ 31 million in 2006 and $ 29 million in 2005 . pro forma effects a table is included in note 1 accounting policies that sets forth pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as if compensation expense had been recognized under sfas 123 and 123r , as amended , for stock options for 2005 . for purposes of computing stock option expense and 2005 pro forma results , we estimated the fair value of stock options using the black-scholes option pricing model . the model requires the use of numerous assumptions , many of which are very subjective . therefore , the 2005 pro forma results are estimates of results of operations as if compensation expense had been recognized for all stock-based compensation awards and are not indicative of the impact on future periods. .\nquestion:what was the total intrinsic value

a net income increase of $ 47 million and an earnings per share decrease of $ 0.14 over 2001 . net income for 2002 reflected lower operating revenue ( $ 204 million ) , operating expenses ( $ 229 million ) and other income ( $ 27 million ) . interest expense and income taxes , which are discussed on a consolidated basis , decreased $ 50 million over 2001 . the earnings per share decrease reflected share dilution . regulated electric sales revenue increased $ 179 million . favorable weather conditions , reflecting increased cooling and heating degree-days , as well as customer growth , are estimated to have contributed $ 133 million and $ 41 million , respectively . fuel rate recoveries increased approximately $ 65 million for 2002 . these recoveries are generally offset by increases in elec- tric fuel expense and do not materially affect income . partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $ 60 million due to other factors not separately measurable , such as the impact of economic conditions on customer usage , as well as variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts . nonregulated electric sales revenue increased $ 9 million . sales revenue from dominion 2019s merchant generation fleet decreased $ 21 million , reflecting a $ 201 million decline due to lower prices partially offset by sales from assets acquired and constructed in 2002 and the inclusion of millstone operations for all of 2002 . revenue from the wholesale marketing of utility generation decreased $ 74 million . due to the higher demand of utility service territory customers during 2002 , less production from utility plant generation was available for profitable sale in the wholesale market . revenue from retail energy sales increased $ 71 million , reflecting primarily customer growth over the prior year . net revenue from dominion 2019s electric trading activities increased $ 33 million , reflecting the effect of favorable price changes on unsettled contracts and higher trading margins . nonregulated gas sales revenue decreased $ 351 million . the decrease included a $ 239 million decrease in sales by dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing opera- tions , reflecting to a large extent declining prices . revenue associated with gas trading operations , net of related cost of sales , decreased $ 112 million . the decrease included $ 70 mil- lion of realized and unrealized losses on the economic hedges of natural gas production by the dominion exploration & pro- duction segment . as described below under selected information 2014 energy trading activities , sales of natural gas by the dominion exploration & production segment at market prices offset these financial losses , resulting in a range of prices contemplated by dominion 2019s overall risk management strategy . the remaining $ 42 million decrease was due to unfavorable price changes on unsettled contracts and lower overall trading margins . those losses were partially offset by contributions from higher trading volumes in gas and oil markets . gas transportation and storage revenue decreased $ 44 million , primarily reflecting lower rates . electric fuel and energy purchases expense increased $ 94 million which included an increase of $ 66 million associated with dominion 2019s energy marketing operations that are not sub- ject to cost-based rate regulation and an increase of $ 28 million associated with utility operations . substantially all of the increase associated with non-regulated energy marketing opera- tions related to higher volumes purchased during the year . for utility operations , energy costs increased $ 66 million for pur- chases subject to rate recovery , partially offset by a $ 38 million decrease in fuel expenses associated with lower wholesale mar- keting of utility plant generation . purchased gas expense decreased $ 245 million associated with dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing oper- ations . this decrease reflected approximately $ 162 million asso- ciated with declining prices and $ 83 million associated with lower purchased volumes . liquids , pipeline capacity and other purchases decreased $ 64 million , primarily reflecting comparably lower levels of rate recoveries of certain costs of transmission operations in the cur- rent year period . the difference between actual expenses and amounts recovered in the period are deferred pending future rate adjustments . other operations and maintenance expense decreased $ 14 million , primarily reflecting an $ 18 million decrease in outage costs due to fewer generation unit outages in the current year . depreciation expense decreased $ 11 million , reflecting decreases in depreciation associated with changes in the esti- mated useful lives of certain electric generation property , par- tially offset by increased depreciation associated with state line and millstone operations . other income decreased $ 27 million , including a $

                "the income approach indicates value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured . both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective . our estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected pricing , remaining developmental effort , operational performance including company- specific synergies , aftermarket retention , product life cycles , material and labor pricing , and other relevant customer , contractual and market factors . where appropriate , the net cash flows are adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions , as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation . the adjusted future cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate . projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money . the market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets , liabilities , or a group of assets and liabilities . valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables . the cost approach , which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used , as appropriate , for property , plant and equipment . the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation . the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $ 2.8 billion of goodwill , all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purposes . substantially all of the goodwill was assigned to our rms business . the goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergies generated by the integration of our products and technologies with those of sikorsky , costs synergies resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain functions , and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition , such as the assembled workforce of sikorsky . determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the exercise of significant judgments , including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows , long-term growth rates and discount rates . the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales , earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions , customer budgets , existing firm orders , expected future orders , contracts with suppliers , labor agreements , changes in working capital , long term business plans and recent operating performance . use of different estimates and judgments could yield different results . impact to 2015 financial results sikorsky 2019s 2015 financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results only for the period from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 . as a result , our consolidated financial results for the year ended december 31 , 2015 do not reflect a full year of sikorsky 2019s results . from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 , sikorsky generated net sales of approximately $ 400 million and operating loss of approximately $ 45 million , inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition . we incurred approximately $ 38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the sikorsky acquisition in 2015 that were expensed as incurred . these costs are included in other income , net on our consolidated statements of earnings . we also incurred approximately $ 48 million in costs associated with issuing the $ 7.0 billion november 2015 notes used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day facility used to finance the acquisition . the financing costs were recorded as a reduction of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt . supplemental pro forma

been notified of termination , but are continuing to work on transferring their responsibilities and employees working on our quality enhancement and remediation efforts and operational excellence initiatives . relocated facilities expenses are the moving costs , lease expenses and other facility costs incurred during the relocation period in connection with relocating certain facilities . certain litigation matters relate to net expenses recognized during the year for the estimated or actual settlement of certain pending litigation and similar claims , including matters where we recognized income from a settlement on more favorable terms than our previous estimate , or we reduced our estimate of a previously recorded contingent liability . these litigation matters have included royalty disputes , patent litigation matters , product liability litigation matters and commercial litigation matters . contract termination costs relate to terminated agreements in connection with the integration of acquired companies and changes to our distribution model as part of business restructuring and operational excellence initiatives . the terminated contracts primarily relate to sales agents and distribution agreements . information technology integration costs are non- capitalizable costs incurred related to integrating information technology platforms of acquired companies or other significant software implementations as part of our quality and operational excellence initiatives . as part of the biomet merger , we recognized $ 209.0 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development ( 201cipr&d 201d ) projects . during 2017 and 2016 , we recorded impairment losses of $ 18.8 million and $ 30.0 million , respectively , related to these ipr&d intangible assets . the impairments were primarily due to the termination of certain ipr&d projects . we also recognized $ 479.0 million of intangible assets for trademarks that we designated as having an indefinite life . during 2017 , we reclassified one of these trademarks to a finite life asset which resulted in an impairment of $ 8.0 million . loss/impairment on disposal of assets relates to assets that we have sold or intend to sell , or for which the economic useful life of the asset has been significantly reduced due to integration or our quality and operational excellence initiatives . contingent consideration adjustments represent the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations to be paid to the prior owners of acquired businesses . certain r&d agreements relate to agreements with upfront payments to obtain intellectual property to be used in r&d projects that have no alternative future use in other projects . cash and cash equivalents 2013 we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents . the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost , which approximates their fair value . accounts receivable 2013 accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables . we grant credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses . we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by geographic market and take into consideration historical credit experience , creditworthiness of the customer and other pertinent information . we make concerted efforts to collect all accounts receivable , but sometimes we have to write-off the account against the allowance when we determine the account is uncollectible . the allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 60.2 million and $ 51.6 million as of december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . inventories 2013 inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market , with cost determined on a first-in first-out basis . property , plant and equipment 2013 property , plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation . depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and improvements and three to eight years for machinery and equipment . maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred . we review property , plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable . an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount . an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value . software costs 2013 we capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended . capitalized software costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software

a domestic contributory defined contribution plan ; international pension plans , which vary by country , consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans ; deferred compensation arrangements ; and certain other post- retirement benefit plans . the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables . cer- tain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate , expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels . we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations . while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges , an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings . the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds . for fiscal 2013 , we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 3.90% ( 3.90 % ) and vary- ing rates on our international plans of between 1.00% ( 1.00 % ) and 7.00% ( 7.00 % ) . the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an aa rating , or equivalent , from a major rating agency . as of june 30 , 2013 , we used an above-mean yield curve , rather than the broad-based yield curve we used before , because we believe it represents a better estimate of an effective settlement rate of the obligation , and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans . the benefit obligation of our domestic plans would have been higher by approximately $ 34 mil- lion at june 30 , 2013 had we not used the above-mean yield curve . for our international plans , the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country , with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan . for fiscal 2013 , we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% ( 7.50 % ) for our u.s . qualified plan and varying rates of between 2.25% ( 2.25 % ) and 7.00% ( 7.00 % ) for our international plans . in determining the long-term rate of return for a plan , we consider the historical rates of return , the nature of the plan 2019s investments and an expectation for the plan 2019s investment strategies . see 201cnote 12 2014 pension , deferred compensation and post-retirement benefit plans 201d of notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan invest- ments . the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accu- mulated other comprehensive income . those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods . for fiscal 2013 , our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $ 74 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $ 64 million . the resulting net deferred gain of approximately $ 10 million , when combined with gains and losses from previous years , will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 22 years . the actual return on plan assets from our international pen- sion plans exceeded expectations , primarily reflecting a strong performance from fixed income and equity invest- ments . the lower than expected return on assets from our u.s . qualified plan was primarily due to weakness in our fixed income investments , partially offset by our strong equity returns . a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2013 pension expense : 25 basis-point 25 basis-point increase decrease ( in millions ) .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>( in millions )</td><td>25 basis-point increase</td><td>25 basis-point decrease</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>discount rate</td><td>$ -3.5 ( 3.5 )</td><td>$ 3.9</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>expected return on assets</td><td>$ -2.5 ( 2.5 )</td><td>$ 2.7</td></tr></table>\nour post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates , which may have a significant effect on the amounts the est{e lauder companies inc . 115 .\nquestion:what was the low rate for international plans?",

                "management 2019s discussion and analysis 132 jpmorgan chase & co./2010 annual report unpaid principal balance due to negative amortization of option arms was $ 24 million and $ 78 million at december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the firm estimates the following balances of option arm loans will experience a recast that results in a payment increase : $ 72 million in 2011 , $ 241 million in 2012 and $ 784 million in 2013 . the firm did not originate option arms and new originations of option arms were discontinued by washington mutual prior to the date of jpmorgan chase 2019s acquisition of its banking operations . subprime mortgages at december 31 , 2010 were $ 11.3 billion , compared with $ 12.5 billion at december 31 , 2009 . the decrease was due to paydowns and charge-offs on delinquent loans , partially offset by the addition of loans as a result of the adoption of the accounting guidance related to vies . late-stage delinquencies remained elevated but continued to improve , albeit at a slower rate during the second half of the year , while early-stage delinquencies stabilized at an elevated level during this period . nonaccrual loans improved largely as a result of the improvement in late-stage delinquencies . charge-offs reflected modest improvement . auto : auto loans at december 31 , 2010 , were $ 48.4 billion , compared with $ 46.0 billion at december 31 , 2009 . delinquent and nonaccrual loans have decreased . in addition , net charge-offs have declined 52% ( 52 % ) from the prior year . provision expense de- creased due to favorable loss severity as a result of a strong used- car market nationwide and reduced loss frequency due to the tightening of underwriting criteria in earlier periods . the auto loan portfolio reflected a high concentration of prime quality credits . business banking : business banking loans at december 31 , 2010 , were $ 16.8 billion , compared with $ 17.0 billion at december 31 , 2009 . the decrease was primarily a result of run-off of the washington mutual portfolio and charge-offs on delinquent loans . these loans primarily include loans which are highly collateralized , often with personal loan guarantees . nonaccrual loans continued to remain elevated . after having increased during the first half of 2010 , nonaccrual loans as of december 31 , 2010 , declined to year-end 2009 levels . student and other : student and other loans at december 31 , 2010 , including loans held-for-sale , were $ 15.3 billion , compared with $ 16.4 billion at december 31 , 2009 . other loans primarily include other secured and unsecured consumer loans . delinquencies reflected some stabilization in the second half of 2010 , but remained elevated . charge-offs during 2010 remained relatively flat with 2009 levels reflecting the impact of elevated unemployment levels . purchased credit-impaired loans : pci loans at december 31 , 2010 , were $ 72.8 billion compared with $ 81.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 . this portfolio represents loans acquired in the washing- ton mutual transaction that were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition . that fair value included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans , and therefore no allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans as of the acquisition date . the firm regularly updates the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected for these loans . probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through the provision for loan losses . probable and significant increases in expected cash flows ( e.g. , decreased principal credit losses , the net benefit of modifications ) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses , with any remaining increase in the expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans . during 2010 , management concluded as part of the firm 2019s regular assessment of the pci pools that it was probable that higher expected principal credit losses would result in a decrease in expected cash flows . accordingly , the firm recognized an aggregate $ 3.4 billion impairment related to the home equity , prime mortgage , option arm and subprime mortgage pci portfolios . as a result of this impairment , the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses for the home equity , prime mortgage , option arm and subprime mortgage pci portfolios was $ 1.6 billion , $ 1.8 billion , $ 1.5 billion and $ 98 million , respectively , at december 31 , 2010 , compared with an allowance for loan losses of $ 1.1 billion and $ 491 million for the prime mortgage and option arm pci portfolios , respectively , at december 31 , 2009 . approximately 39% ( 39 % ) of the option arm borrowers were delinquent , 5% ( 5 % ) were making interest-only or negatively amortizing payments , and 56% ( 56 % ) were making amortizing payments . approximately 50% ( 50 % ) of current borrowers are subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast ; substantially all of the remaining loans have been modified to a fixed rate fully amortizing loan . the cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance of the option arm pci pool was $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.9 billion at de- cember 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the firm estimates the following balances of option arm pci loans will experience a recast that results in a payment increase : $ 1.2 billion in 2011 , $ 2.7 billion in 2012 and $ 508 million in 2013 . the following table provides a summary of lifetime loss estimates included in both the nonaccretable difference and the allowance for loan losses . principal charge-offs will not be recorded on these pools until the nonaccretable difference has been fully depleted . lifetime loss estimates ( a ) ltd liquidation losses

( such further revisions are commonly referred to as 201cbasel iii 201d ) . basel iii revised basel ii by , among other things , narrowing the definition of capital , and increasing capital requirements for specific exposures . basel iii also includes higher capital ratio requirements and provides that the tier 1 common capital requirement will be increased to 7% ( 7 % ) , comprised of a minimum ratio of 4.5% ( 4.5 % ) plus a 2.5% ( 2.5 % ) capital conservation buffer . implementation of the 7% ( 7 % ) tier 1 common capital requirement is required by january 1 , in addition , global systemically important banks ( 201cgsibs 201d ) will be required to maintain tier 1 common requirements above the 7% ( 7 % ) minimum in amounts ranging from an additional 1% ( 1 % ) to an additional 2.5% ( 2.5 % ) . in november 2012 , the financial stability board ( 201cfsb 201d ) indicated that it would require the firm , as well as three other banks , to hold the additional 2.5% ( 2.5 % ) of tier 1 common ; the requirement will be phased in beginning in 2016 . the basel committee also stated it intended to require certain gsibs to hold an additional 1% ( 1 % ) of tier 1 common under certain circumstances , to act as a disincentive for the gsib from taking actions that would further increase its systemic importance . currently , no gsib ( including the firm ) is required to hold this additional 1% ( 1 % ) of tier 1 common . in addition , pursuant to the requirements of the dodd-frank act , u.s . federal banking agencies have proposed certain permanent basel i floors under basel ii and basel iii capital calculations . the following table presents a comparison of the firm 2019s tier 1 common under basel i rules to its estimated tier 1 common under basel iii rules , along with the firm 2019s estimated risk-weighted assets . tier 1 common under basel iii includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in basel i tier 1 common , such as the inclusion of aoci related to afs securities and defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit ( 201copeb 201d ) plans . the firm estimates that its tier 1 common ratio under basel iii rules would be 8.7% ( 8.7 % ) as of december 31 , 2012 . the tier 1 common ratio under both basel i and basel iii are non- gaap financial measures . however , such measures are used by bank regulators , investors and analysts as a key measure to assess the firm 2019s capital position and to compare the firm 2019s capital to that of other financial services companies . december 31 , 2012 ( in millions , except ratios ) .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>tier 1 common under basel i rules</td><td>$ 140342</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>adjustments related to aoci for afs securities and defined benefit pension and opeb plans</td><td>4077</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>all other adjustments</td><td>-453 ( 453 )</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>estimated tier 1 common under basel iii rules</td><td>$ 143966</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>estimated risk-weighted assets under basel iii rules ( a )</td><td>$ 1647903</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>estimated tier 1 common ratio under basel iii rules ( b )</td><td>8.7% ( 8.7 % )</td></tr></table>\nestimated risk-weighted assets under basel iii rules ( a ) $ 1647903 estimated tier 1 common ratio under basel iii rules ( b ) 8.7% ( 8.7 % ) ( a ) key differences in the calculation of risk-weighted assets between basel i and basel iii include : ( 1 ) basel iii credit risk rwa is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters , whereas basel i rwa is based on fixed supervisory risk weightings which vary only by counterparty type and asset class ; ( 2 ) basel iii market risk rwa reflects the new capital requirements related to trading assets and securitizations , which include incremental capital requirements for stress var , correlation trading , and re-securitization positions ; and ( 3 ) basel iii includes rwa for operational risk , whereas basel i does not . the actual impact on the firm 2019s capital ratios upon implementation could differ depending on final implementation guidance from the regulators , as well as regulatory approval of certain of the firm 2019s internal risk models . ( b ) the tier 1 common ratio is tier 1 common divided by rwa . the firm 2019s estimate of its tier 1 common ratio under basel iii reflects its current understanding of the basel iii rules based on information currently published by the basel committee and u.s . federal banking agencies and on the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted ; it excludes the impact of any changes the firm may make in the future to its businesses as a result of implementing the basel iii rules , possible enhancements to certain market risk models , and any further implementation guidance from the regulators . the basel iii capital requirements are subject to prolonged transition periods . the transition period for banks to meet the tier 1 common requirement under basel iii was originally scheduled to begin in 2013 , with full implementation on january 1 , 2019 . in november 2012 , the u.s . federal banking agencies announced a delay in the implementation dates for the basel iii capital requirements . the additional capital requirements for gsibs will be phased in starting january 1 , 2016 , with full implementation on january 1 , 2019 . management 2019s current objective is for the firm to reach , by the end of 2013 , an estimated basel iii tier i common ratio of 9.5% ( 9.5 % ) . additional information regarding the firm 2019s capital ratios and the federal regulatory capital standards to which it is subject is presented in supervision and regulation on pages 1 20138 of the 2012 form 10-k , and note 28 on pages 306 2013 308 of this annual report . broker-dealer regulatory capital jpmorgan chase 2019s principal u.s . broker-dealer subsidiaries are j.p . morgan securities llc ( 201cjpmorgan securities 201d ) and j.p . morgan clearing corp .

divestiture costs ) compared with $ 1.1 billion ( both including and excluding costs associated with signing an agree- ment to acquire temple-inland ) in 2011 and $ 763 million ( $ 776 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 . sales volumes for the legacy business were about flat in 2012 compared with 2011 . average sales price was lower mainly due to export containerboard sales prices which bottomed out in the first quarter but climbed steadily the rest of the year . input costs were lower for recycled fiber , wood and natural gas , but higher for starch . freight costs also increased . plan- ned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2011 . operating costs were higher largely due to routine inventory valuation adjustments operating profits in 2012 benefited from $ 235 million of temple-inland synergies . market-related downtime in 2012 was about 570000 tons compared with about 380000 tons in 2011 . operating profits in 2012 included $ 184 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of temple-inland and $ 91 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills . operating profits in 2011 included charges of $ 20 million for costs associated with the signing of the agreement to acquire temple- inland . looking ahead to 2013 , sales volumes in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to increase slightly for boxes due to a higher number of shipping days . average sales price realizations are expected to reflect the pass-through to box customers of a containerboard price increase implemented in 2012 . input costs are expected to be higher for recycled fiber , wood and starch . planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $ 26 million higher with outages scheduled at eight mills compared with six mills in the 2012 fourth quarter . manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower . european industr ia l packaging net sales were $ 1.0 billion in

and $ 70 mil- lion ( $ 73 million before closure costs for our etienne mill ) in 2010 . sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 reflecting decreased demand for packaging in the industrial market due to a weaker overall economic environment in southern europe . demand for pack- aging in the agricultural markets was about flat year- over-year . average sales margins increased due to sales price increases implemented during 2011 and 2012 and lower board costs . other input costs were higher , primarily for energy and distribution . operat- ing profits in 2012 included a net gain of $ 10 million for an insurance settlement , partially offset by addi- tional operating costs , related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may which affected our san felice box plant . entering the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes are expected to be stable reflecting a seasonal decrease in market demand in agricultural markets offset by an increase in industrial markets . average sales margins are expected to improve due to lower input costs for containerboard . other input costs should be about flat . operating costs are expected to be higher reflecting the absence of the earthquake insurance settlement that was received in the 2012 fourth quar- asian industr ia l packaging net sales and operating profits include the results of sca pack- aging since the acquisition on

2010 . operating profits were favorably impacted by higher average sales margins in 2012 compared with 2011 , but this benefit was offset by lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs and operating costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to decrease due to seasonality . net sales for the distribution operations were $ 260 million in 2012 compared with $ 285 million in 2011 and $ 240 million in 2010 . operating profits were $ 3 million in 2012 compared with $ 3 million in 2011 and about breakeven in 2010.

                "the segment had operating earnings of $ 709 million in 2007 , compared to operating earnings of $ 787 million in 2006 . the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin , driven by : ( i ) lower net sales of iden infrastructure equipment , and ( ii ) continued competitive pricing pressure in the market for gsm infrastructure equipment , partially offset by : ( i ) increased net sales of digital entertainment devices , and ( ii ) the reversal of reorganization of business accruals recorded in 2006 relating to employee severance which were no longer needed . sg&a expenses increased primarily due to the expenses from recently acquired businesses , partially offset by savings from cost-reduction initiatives . r&d expenditures decreased primarily due to savings from cost- reduction initiatives , partially offset by expenditures by recently acquired businesses and continued investment in digital entertainment devices and wimax . as a percentage of net sales in 2007 as compared to 2006 , gross margin , sg&a expenses , r&d expenditures and operating margin all decreased . in 2007 , sales to the segment 2019s top five customers represented approximately 43% ( 43 % ) of the segment 2019s net sales . the segment 2019s backlog was $ 2.6 billion at december 31 , 2007 , compared to $ 3.2 billion at december 31 , 2006 . in the home business , demand for the segment 2019s products depends primarily on the level of capital spending by broadband operators for constructing , rebuilding or upgrading their communications systems , and for offering advanced services . during the second quarter of 2007 , the segment began shipping digital set-tops that support the federal communications commission ( 201cfcc 201d ) 2014 mandated separable security requirement . fcc regulations mandating the separation of security functionality from set-tops went into effect on july 1 , 2007 . as a result of these regulations , many cable service providers accelerated their purchases of set-tops in the first half of 2007 . additionally , in 2007 , our digital video customers significantly increased their purchases of the segment 2019s products and services , primarily due to increased demand for digital entertainment devices , particularly hd/dvr devices . during 2007 , the segment completed the acquisitions of : ( i ) netopia , inc. , a broadband equipment provider for dsl customers , which allows for phone , tv and fast internet connections , ( ii ) tut systems , inc. , a leading developer of edge routing and video encoders , ( iii ) modulus video , inc. , a provider of mpeg-4 advanced coding compression systems designed for delivery of high-value video content in ip set-top devices for the digital video , broadcast and satellite marketplaces , ( iv ) terayon communication systems , inc. , a provider of real-time digital video networking applications to cable , satellite and telecommunication service providers worldwide , and ( v ) leapstone systems , inc. , a provider of intelligent multimedia service delivery and content management applications to networks operators . these acquisitions enhance our ability to provide complete end-to-end systems for the delivery of advanced video , voice and data services . in december 2007 , motorola completed the sale of ecc to emerson for $ 346 million in cash . enterprise mobility solutions segment the enterprise mobility solutions segment designs , manufactures , sells , installs and services analog and digital two-way radio , voice and data communications products and systems for private networks , wireless broadband systems and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions to a wide range of enterprise markets , including government and public safety agencies ( which , together with all sales to distributors of two-way communication products , are referred to as the 201cgovernment and public safety market 201d ) , as well as retail , energy and utilities , transportation , manufacturing , healthcare and other commercial customers ( which , collectively , are referred to as the 201ccommercial enterprise market 201d ) . in 2008 , the segment 2019s net sales represented 27% ( 27 % ) of the company 2019s consolidated net sales , compared to 21% ( 21 % ) in 2007 and 13% ( 13 % ) in 2006 .

and about $ 245 million from fire control systems programs primarily related to the sof clss program , which began late in the third quarter of 2010 . partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales due to decreased volume of approximately $ 75 million primarily from various services programs and approximately $ 20 million from tactical missile programs ( primarily mlrs and jassm ) . mfc 2019s operating profit for 2011 increased $ 96 million , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of about $ 60 million for air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) as a result of increased volume and retirement of risks ; and approximately $ 25 million for various services programs . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit rate adjustments described above , were approximately $ 35 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 . backlog backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders and lower sales on fire control systems programs ( primarily lantirn ae and sniper ae ) and on various services programs , partially offset by lower orders and higher sales volume on tactical missiles programs . backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased orders on air and missile defense programs ( primarily thaad ) . trends we expect mfc 2019s net sales for 2013 will be comparable with 2012 . we expect low double digit percentage growth in air and missile defense programs , offset by an expected decline in volume on logistics services programs . operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with 2012 results . mission systems and training our mst business segment provides surface ship and submarine combat systems ;

lcs ; vls ; and mh-60 ) ; about $ 115 million for training and logistics solutions programs primarily due to net sales from sim industries , which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 ; and approximately $ 30 million as a result of increased volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs ( primarily aegis ) . partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $ 70 million from undersea systems programs due to lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems ; and about $ 25 million due to lower volume on various other programs . mst 2019s operating profit for 2012 increased $ 92 million , or 14% ( 14 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 175 million from ship and aviation system programs , which reflects higher volume and risk retirements on certain programs ( primarily vls ; ptds ; mh-60 ; and lcs ) and reserves of about $ 55 million for contract cost matters on ship and aviation system programs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 ( including the terminated presidential helicopter program ) . partially offsetting the increase was lower operating profit of approximately $ 40 million from undersea systems programs due to reduced profit booking rates on certain programs and lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems ; and about $ 40 million due to lower volume on various other programs . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 150 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. .\nquestion:what was the change in the mst net sales from 2010 to 2011?",

                "the analysis of our depreciation studies . changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively . under group depreciation , the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized . the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies . the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes . because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired , we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate . in addition , we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies . any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets . for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business , a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual , ( ii ) is material in amount , and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies . a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations . when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties , which is typically performed by our employees , and for track line expansion and other capacity projects . costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance , including rail grinding , are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.1 billion for 2012 , $ 2.2 billion for 2011 , and $ 2.0 billion for 2010 . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 12 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions 2012 2011 .\n<table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>millions</td><td>dec . 31 2012</td><td>dec . 312011</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>accounts payable</td><td>$ 825</td><td>$ 819</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>accrued wages and vacation</td><td>376</td><td>363</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>income and other taxes</td><td>368</td><td>482</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>dividends payable</td><td>318</td><td>284</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>accrued casualty costs</td><td>213</td><td>249</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>interest payable</td><td>172</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>equipment rents payable</td><td>95</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>other</td><td>556</td><td>624</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>total accounts payable and othercurrent liabilities</td><td>$ 2923</td><td>$ 3108</td></tr></table>\n.\nquestion:what was the value of accrued wages and vacation in 2012?",

the changes in fair value during the years ended december 31 , 2009 and 2008 due to instrument-specific credit risk resulted in a $ 10 million loss and $ 32 million loss , respectively . related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated statement of income . mortgage servicing rights the company accounts for mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value . fair value for msrs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach . this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates . the model assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates . the fair value of msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates . in managing this risk , the company hedges a significant portion of the values of its msrs through the use of interest-rate derivative contracts , forward-purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities , and purchased securities classified as trading . see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs . these msrs , which totaled $ 6.5 billion and $ 5.7 billion as of december 31 , 2009

interest rates , inflation or currency risks ( 201cstructured liabilities 201d ) . the company elected the fair value option , because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair value basis . these positions will continue to be classified as debt , deposits or derivatives ( trading account liabilities ) on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form . for those structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair value by $ 125 million and $ 671 million as of december 31 , 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the change in fair value for these structured liabilities is reported in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . related interest expense is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . certain non-structured liabilities the company has elected the fair value option for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates ( 201cnon-structured liabilities 201d ) . the company has elected the fair value option where the interest-rate risk of such liabilities is economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings . the election has been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications . these positions are reported in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . for those non-structured liabilities classified as short-term borrowings for which the fair value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 220 million as of december 31 , 2008 . for non-structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair value by $ 1542 million

                "our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined , including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries , the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses , including depreciation . the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil , commonly used by the industry as an indicator of the impact of price on the refining margin . crack spreads can fluctuate significantly , particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil . as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants , we calculate midwest ( chicago ) and u.s . gulf coast crack spreads that we feel most closely track our operations and slate of products . posted light louisiana sweet ( 201clls 201d ) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products ( 6 barrels of crude oil producing 3 barrels of gasoline , 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel ) are used for the crack spread calculation . the following table lists calculated average crack spreads by quarter for the midwest ( chicago ) and gulf coast markets in 2008 . crack spreads ( dollars per barrel ) 1st qtr 2nd qtr 3rd qtr 4th qtr 2008 .\n<table

)</td><td>$ 2.45</td></tr></table>\nin addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads , our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed , the selling prices realized for refined products , the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to mitigate price risk and the cost of purchased products for resale . we process significant amounts of sour crude oil which can enhance our profitability compared to certain of our competitors , as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil . finally , our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by changes in manufacturing costs , which are primarily driven by the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas used for plant fuel . our 2008 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin was the key driver of the 43 percent decrease in rm&t segment income when compared to 2007 . our average refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon decreased 37 percent , to 11.66 cents in 2008 from 18.48 cents in 2007 , primarily due to the significant and rapid increases in crude oil prices early in 2008 and lagging wholesale price realizations . our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates , which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of refined products , including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes , also impacts rm&t segment profitability . while on average demand has been increasing for several years , there are numerous factors including local competition , seasonal demand fluctuations , the available wholesale supply , the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year . in 2008 , demand began to drop due to the combination of significant increases in retail petroleum prices and a broad slowdown in general activity . the gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets has historically been more constant . the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through our crude oil and refined products pipelines . the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of , and refiner demand for , crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines . key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers , the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation , and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels . the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of , and user demand for , refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines . in most of our markets , demand for gasoline peaks during the summer and declines during the fall and winter months , whereas distillate demand is more ratable throughout the year . as with crude oil , other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements . integrated gas our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand . our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas , such as lng and methanol , primarily in the u.s. , europe and west africa . our most significant lng investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in equatorial guinea , which sells lng under a long-term contract at prices tied to henry hub
