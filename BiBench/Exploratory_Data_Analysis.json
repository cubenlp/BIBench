It expands upon the previous Berkeley Earth temperature data set by including predictive structures based on historical weather patterns and increasing the underlying resolution to 0.25Â° x 0.25Â° latitude-longitude.\n\nFiles based on this new data set are being provided as part of an early preview to aid in the identification of any remaining bugs or errors.  While, we believe the current data set to be accurate and useful, it is still in development and substantial revisions remain possible if significant issues are identified.\n\nThis file contains a detailed summary of the changes in Earth's global average surface temperature estimated by combining the new high-resolution Berkeley Earth land-surface temperature field with a reinterpolated version of the HadSST4 ocean temperature field.  \n\nAs a preliminary data product, no citation for this work currently exists.\n \nThis global data product merges land-surface air temperatures with ocean sea surface water temperatures.  For most of the ocean, sea surface temperatures are similar to near-surface air temperatures; however, air temperatures above sea ice can differ substantially from the water below the sea ice.  In sea ice regions, temperature anomalies are extrapolated from the land-surface air temperatures when ice is present, and from the ocean temperatures when ice is absent.\n\nThe percent coverage of sea ice was taken from the HadISST v2 dataset and varies by month and location.  In the typical month, between 3.5% and 5.5% of the Earth's surface is covered with sea ice. For more information on the processing and use of HadISST and HadSST refer to the description file for the combined gridded data product. \n \nTemperature data contributing to this analysis include (but are not limited to): \n \nGHCN-Monhtly v4, Menne et al. 2018, https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0094.1\n\nGlobal Summary of the Day, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/global-summary-day\n MET-Reader, Scientific Committee for Antaractic Research, British Antarctic Survey,\n    https://legacy.bas.ac.uk/met/READER/\n HADSST4, Kennedy et al. 2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JD029867\n \nIce mask data comes from: \n \n HadISST2, Titcher and Rayner 2014, https://doi.org/10.1002/2013JD020316\n Sea Ice Index, NSIDC, https://nsidc.org/data/g02135/versions/3\n \n High-resolution downscaling algorithms were trained using high-resolution data,\n though none of this data is used directly in the reconstruction.

It simulates the conditions of agricultural yield based on various environmental and management factors. The purpose of this dataset is to provide a robust platform for developing predictive models that estimate agricultural yields.\n\n**Context:**\nAgricultural yield prediction is a vital area of study that can benefit from the application of predictive modeling. Accurate yield predictions can help in optimizing agricultural production, managing supply chains, and ensuring food security. This synthetic dataset has been created to emulate real-world agricultural data, complete with introduced outliers to challenge and improve the resilience of predictive models.\n\n**Content:**\nThe dataset contains 20,000 entries with the following features:\n\n- Soil_Quality: Soil quality index, ranging from 50 to 100.\n- Seed_Variety: Binary indicator of seed variety, where 1 represents a high-yield variety.\n- Fertilizer_Amount_kg_per_hectare: The amount of fertilizer used in kilograms per hectare.\n- Sunny_Days: The number of sunny days during the growing season.\n- Rainfall_mm: Total rainfall received during the growing season in millimeters.\n- Irrigation_Schedule: The number of irrigations during the growing season.\n- Yield_kg_per_hectare: The agricultural yield in kilograms per hectare, serving as the target variable for prediction.\n\nOutliers have been intentionally introduced into the Fertilizer_Amount_kg_per_hectare and Yield_kg_per_hectare columns to simulate real-world anomalies and provide a testbed for outlier detection and robust regression techniques.\n\n**Acknowledgments:**\nThis dataset is synthetic and generated for the purpose of machine learning practice. It is not based on real-world data, hence no acknowledgments to external sources are necessary.\n\n**Inspiration:**\nPotential uses of this dataset include:\n\n- Developing and testing regression models.\n- Practicing outlier detection and handling.\n- Exploring feature importance and selection techniques.\n- Conducting robustness checks of machine learning algorithms.\n- Experimenting with different data preprocessing techniques.\nFeel free to explore this dataset and share your insights on yield prediction models and outlier influence on model performance.\n\n",

The numbering of stations in the dataset is done from the target station upstream, ie closest to it - first, upstream - second, etc.\n\nData are average monthly. The number of observations on stations is different (from 4 to about 20 years).\n\nTraining and test data are chosen so that the percentage of non-NA values on stations with long and short series data is approximately the same. Test data do not contain target column, as in the future it is planned to organize a competition to predict this data.\n\nSuspended substances concentration (SSC) is measured in mg/cub. dm (ie milligrams in the cubic decimeter).\n\nThe maximum permissible value of SSC in Ukraine is 15 mg/cub. dm.\n\nId - the unique id of a given monthly averaged data;\n\ntarget - a values of monthly averaged data of SSC in target station, mg/cub. dm;\n\n1-7 - a values of monthly averaged data of SSC in stations 1-7 (in seven stations located from the target station upstream), mg/cub. dm.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nI thank the [State Water Resources Agency of Ukraine](https://www.davr.gov.ua/) and the Portal (https://data.gov.ua/) for providing data of water monitoring data which used for this dataset.\n\nAnd grateful for the photo provided me for dataset image: photo by [Samara Doole](https://unsplash.com/@samaradoole?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/T8-kfC8W4b8).\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nThe most interesting are the following tasks:\n\n1.

This means that there are articles published in 2016 and in 2022, but the number of articles in this dataset published in 2016 is not the same as the number of articles published in 2022.

Unemployment indicates the health of the economy. \nThe unemployment rate is the most frequent measure of unemployment. The unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed divided by the working population or people working under labor.\n\n## Why does unemployment occur?\n- Large population.\n- Lack of vocational skills or low educational levels of the working population.\n- Legal complexities, Inadequate state support, and low infrastructural, financial, and market linkages to small businesses make such enterprises unviable with cost and compliance overruns.\n- Inadequate growth of infrastructure and low investments in the manufacturing sector, hence restricting the employment potential of the secondary sector.\n- The huge workforce of the country is associated with the informal sector because of a lack of required education or skills, and this data is not captured in employment statistics.\n- The main cause of structural unemployment is the education provided in schools and colleges is not as per the current requirements of the industries. \n",

Chess games of this period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.\nPeople did not care about their pieces, pawn, sometimes even sacrificing their Queens, just to attack the enemy King, Long-term strategic planning, that was for the coward's, the goal of the game for everyone was to checkmate the other enemy.\nKey Players - Alexander McDonnell, Louis-Charles MahÃ© de La Bourdonnais, Howard Staunton, Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulses.\nAnd the most important Paul Morpy, who was the best player at his time.\nYou might have not heard of them but you might still come across their name's via Opening's like Bird's Defence, Staunton Gambit etc.\nClassical Era¶\nMorphyâs eventual successor, Wilhelm Steinitz, reigned as world champion until 1894. Steinitz managed to retain his superiority for so long because he developed new principles of the middlegame, particularly in closed or semiclosed positions, that only his successor, Emanuel Lasker, and Laskerâs contemporaries fully appreciated. \nSteinitz said his âmodern schoolâ was guided by two premises:\n\nthat the natural outcome of a game is a draw because of the inherent balance between the forces of White and Black \nthat checkmate is the ultimate but not the first objective of the game.\n\nThe games had begun to move to the Hyper Mordern Era, and Steinitz was the one who started it, People had started realizing that the way to justify a decisive attack in the post-Morphy era was to accumulate small, often subtle, advantages â for example, having two bishops when oneâs opponent has two knights, having an entrenched knight at a fortified outpost, or having greater maneuvering space.\nPeople had started to develop Positional Play, they had started to try to accumulate slow advantages, than going straight for the king with badly coordinated pieces\n\nThis is as far as we go, since after 1915, Hypermordern Era starts, but the games we have access to is only till 1914*\n\n\n\nNo. of moves¶\ncreate_countplot('No_of_moves',r=True)\n\nWinner¶\ncreate_countplot('Winner',sort=True, r=True)\n\nFirst Move¶Most of the games first move was 1e4, this move led to open positions with many posibilites for tactics and attacks, A romantic Era classic, but as we can see 1d4, the move that leads to closed, positional games, shows that slowly people are moving towards, Hypermordern Era.\n\ncreate_countplot('First_move',r=True)\n\nPlayers¶As you can see, players like Capablanca (world chess champion from 1921 to 1927), Tarrasch (Tarrasch Defence named after him), Edward Lasker (Dethroned Steinitz), Niemzowitsch (Niemzowitch Defence named after him), Rubinstein (Rubinstein Trap, a opening trap in the Queen's Gambit Declined), and so on.\nAll of the games covered are of players who had huge impacts on the development of chess.\n\nset_a = pd.concat([df[\"White\"],df[\"Black\"]], axis=0)\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\nsns.countplot(y=set_a, palette='crest_r', order=set_a.value_counts().index)\n\nOpening¶For all you Queen's Gambit Fan's, you might have heard of some of these in the show\nNote though, Positional Game is still developing in the Classical Era, Ruy Lopez, French Defence, Giuoco Piano, Caro-Kann Defence, are all reached after 1.e4, so don't let this graph make you think that Queen's gambit is significantly played in this Era.\n\ncreate_countplot('Opening',sort=True, r=True)\n\nBook Corpus¶\ndf[\"Game_path\"] = \"../input/corpuschessstratergybook/Games/\" + df[\"Game-file\"]\nf = open('../input/corpuschessstratergybook/clean.txt',\"r\").read()\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\nstopwords = list(STOPWORDS) + [\"PXP\",\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\",\"F\",\"G\",\"H\",\"Q\",\"K\",\"Kt\",\"K3\",\"K4\",\"Kt5\",\"R3\",\"Q3\",\"QB3\",\"Q2\",\"K5\",\"KtxP\",\"Kt3\",\"B2\",\"Kt1\",\"R7\",\"KB3\",\"B6\",\"RxP\",\"KKt4\",\"etc\",\"BxKt\",\"B4\",\"B3\",\"Q4\",\"Q5\",\"QR4\",\"R1\",\"B1\",\"B5\",\"KtxKt\",\"S\",\"R4\",\"QR3\",\"K2\",\"K6\",\"Kt4\",\"R2\",\"KB\",\"K1\",\"QB\"\"KR\",\"PxKt\",\"QxP\",\"QP\",\"PxB\",\"KB4\",\"QKt\",\"Q6\",\"Kt2\",\"QR\",\"Q1\",\"Q7\",\"B7\",\"KR3\",\"BxB\"\"QB4\",\"BxP\",\"KxP\",\"R5ch\",\"Qkt4\",\"QxKt\",\"Kt7\",\"QxPch\",\"R6\",\"BxPch\",\"KR4\",\"RxKt\",\"QB\",\"KR\",\"KKt3\",\"KKt\",\"QBP\",\"KKt1\",\"B7ch\",\"Ktch\",\"B6ch\",\"Kt6\",\"KtxB\",\"RxB\",\"BxB\",\"QKt3\",\"QB4\",\"QxP\",\"KP\",\"B7ch\",\"R5\",\"QxB\",\"KKt5\",\"BxR\"]\nwordcloud = WordCloud(width = 800, height = 800,\n                background_color ='white',\n                stopwords = stopwords,\n                min_font_size = 10).generate(f)\n  \n# plot the WordCloud image                       \nplt.figure(figsize = (8, 8), facecolor = None)\nplt.imshow(wordcloud)\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.tight_layout(pad = 0)\n  \nplt.show()\n\nLet me explain some of the most occuring text's :-\n\nPawn, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, King - all of these are the pieces in the game\nPosition - describes how pieces are placed on the chessboard\nCentre - the 4 square exactly in the middle of the board, modern day games mostly revolve around controlling these squares with and pawns and pieces, as controling them gives positional advantages\nDevelopment - Moving pieces, Castling, or connecting rooks\nFiles - columns that go up and down the chessboard, idealy you want to have your rooks on a open file\nDiagonal - diagonals of the chessboard, idealy you want to have your bishops in the longest diagonals\nPassed pawn - pawns that don't have any enemy pawns in their path to Queening\nExchange - Trading a piece for an enemy's piece\n\nOne really cool thing I like about this word cloud is that they don't have Blunder's in them, given that these were played by top player's at that time, it is obvious that they won't be making alot of Blunder's(Game losing moves), but we beginner's, intermediate and even Advanced players have a lot of blunders happen in our games.",

An improved feature extraction technique is employed by leveraging the browser automation framework (i.e., Selenium WebDriver), which is more precise and robust compared to the parsing approach based on regular expressions. \n\nAnti-phishing researchers and experts may find this dataset useful for phishing features analysis, conducting rapid proof of concept experiments or benchmarking phishing classification models.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nTan, Choon Lin (2018), “Phishing Dataset for Machine Learning: Feature Evaluation”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/h3cgnj8hft.1\n[Source of the Dataset.](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h3cgnj8hft/1)",

Illustrative Examples of Chest X-Rays in Patients with Pneumonia, Related to Figure 6\nThe normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.\nhttp://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal).  There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). \n\nChest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care. \n\nFor the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nData: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2\n\nLicense: [CC BY 4.0][1]\n\nCitation: http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\n### Inspiration\n\nAutomated methods to detect and classify human diseases from medical images.\n\n\n  [1]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n  [2]: https://i.imgur.com/8AUJkin.png",

        "output": "!\n\n\nIntroduction¶Hey you! My fellow data enthusiasts, I am here to present to you IMDB Data Analysis. The dataset used is IMDB Movies Dataset by **Harshit Shankhdhar** from Kaggle itself.\nSo, let's get started....\nGetting Started¶About this Dataset:\n\nIMDb is an online database of information related to films, television series, podcasts, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. It is the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content.\nContent\nData:-\nPoster_Link - Link of the poster that imdb using\nSeries_Title = Name of the movie\nReleased_Year - Year at which that movie released\nCertificate - Certificate earned by that movie\nRuntime - Total runtime of the movie\nGenre - Genre of the movie\nIMDB_Rating - Rating of the movie at IMDB site\nOverview - mini story/ summary\nMeta_score - Score earned by the movie\nDirector - Name of the Director\nStar1,Star2,Star3,Star4 - Name of the Stars\nNo_of_votes - Total number of votes\nGross - Money earned by that movie\nInstalling and importing dependencies\n\nWe will be using the following libraries:\nPandas: It is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.\nNumpy: It is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.\nMatplotlib: It is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, etc) for Python.\nSeaborn: It is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\nWordcloud: A visualization technique to represent the frequency of words in a text where the size of the word represents its frequency\n\n\nData Preparation and Cleaning¶\n\nAs we don't need Poster_Link and Overview columns let's drop them\n\n\nLet's find the no.of null values in each column\n\n\nTreating null values in Certificate column using mode\n\n\nTo change the datatype of Gross column we first need to remove the ',' so that it is easier to change the dtype to float without any errors and then replacing null values with zero\n\n\nNow let's treat the null values in Meta_score column\n\n\nWe are going to use KNNImputer;\nThe KNNImputer is used to fill in missing values in a dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors method. k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is used for classification and prediction problems. The KNNImputer predicts the value of a missing value by observing trends in related columns.\n\n\nThis is our final Dataframe\n\n\nNow since we have treated the null values, Let's change the dtype of Runtime from object to int to make the values more easier to understand\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis and Visualization¶\n\nSince I like dark background alot, I used plt.style.use(\"dark_background\") to change all of them to Dark backgrounds :P\n\n\nFive Highest Rated Movies¶\n\nMost Popular Genre¶\n\nDistribution of each numeric column¶\n\nTop 5 Grossing movies¶\n\nReleased_Year vs. IMDB_Rating¶\n\nIMDB Rating Yearly trend¶\n\nIMDB Rating vs. Runtime¶\n\nCount of each rating¶\n\nTop 5 Directors with highest no. of contents¶\n\nGross vs. IMDB Rating¶\n\nAverage IMDB Rating of these Directors¶\n\nMost popular Director¶\n\nIMDB Rating Yearly Trend¶\n\nGross yearly trend¶\n\nWhat was the Genre Steven majorly worked on?\n\n\nWho are the top 10 Directors with highest average IMDB Rating?¶\n\nDirector with highest Average IMDB Rating¶\n\nFrank Darabont movies' IMDB Rating Yearly Trend¶\n\nGross yearly trend line¶\n\nLet's make an interactive graph using plotly and look deeper in the Certificate distribution of Movies.¶\n\nSince the Size of the bubbles is determined by the Gross value therefore there might be some dots which are not visible but it shows the information as they have 0 Gross value and TV-14,16,TV-MA Certificates have in total zero grosiing value therefore the are not plotted.\n\n\nConclusion¶\n\n\nThere is positive relation between No. of Votes and IMDB Rating and also No. of Votes and Gross values\nAmong the top 1000 movies, many of the movies were from 2000-2020\nMost common runtime is around 100-150 mins\nMost common IMDB Rating is 7.5-8\nFive Highest Rated movies are:\n\nComedy Drama and Crime Drama are the most popular Genres\nTop 5 Grossing Movies are:\n\nEven though most of the movies are from 2000-2020, the IMDB Rating of all of the movies were from 7.8-8.2, this canbe because many people watch latest movies hence get alot of votes and this is not th case with older movies, maybe this can be misleading sometimes.\nMovies with U certrificate are most common, followed by A, UA, R\n\nAlfred Hitchcock had the most no. of movies listed in the top 1000s followed by Steven Spielberg and Hayao Miyazaki\nAmong them Steven Spielberg had the highest average IMDB Rating for more analysis on his project you can see above\nThe most popular director was Frank Darabont with 8.95 Average IMDB Rating followed by Irvin Kershner and Lana Wachowski for more analysis on Frank Darabont's projects yoy can see above\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like the notebook I've prepared, an upvote would be really apreciated :D",

With a corpus of 100,000 unlabeled images and 500 training images, this dataset is best for developing unsupervised feature learning, deep learning, self-taught learning algorithms. Unlike CIFAR-10, the dataset has a higher resolution which makes it a challenging benchmark for developing more scalable unsupervised learning methods. \n\n### Content\n\nData overview: \n\n- There are three files: train_image.zips, test_images.zip and unlabeled_images.zip\n- 10 classes: airplane, bird, car, cat, deer, dog, horse, monkey, ship, truck\n- Images are 96x96 pixels, color\n- 500 training images (10 pre-defined folds), 800 test images per class\n- 100,000 unlabeled images for unsupervised learning. These examples are extracted from a similar but broader distribution of images. For instance, it contains other types of animals (bears, rabbits, etc.) and vehicles (trains, buses, etc.) in addition to the ones in the labeled set\n- Images were acquired from labeled examples on ImageNet\n\nThe original data source recommends the following standardized testing protocol for reporting results:\n\n1. Perform unsupervised training on the unlabeled data\n2. Perform supervised training on the labeled data using 10 (pre-defined) folds of 100 examples from the training data. The indices of the examples to be used for each fold are provided\n3. Report average accuracy on the full test set\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nOriginal data source and banner image: https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/\n\nPlease cite the following reference when using this dataset:\n\nAdam Coates, Honglak Lee, Andrew Y.

Users are able to post short or long comments on movies and give them marks. This dataset contains more than 2 million short comments of 28 movies in Douban Movie website. It can be used on text classification, text clustering, sentiment analysis, semantic web construction and some other fields that relate to web mining or NLP (of Chinese lol).\n\n## Metadata\n**ID** the ID of the comment (start from 0) <br />\n**Movie_Name_EN** the English name of the movie <br />\n**Movie_Name_CN** the Chinese name of the movie <br />\n**Crawl_Date** the date that the data are crawled <br />\n**Number** the number of the comment <br />\n**Username** the username of the account <br />\n**Date** the date that the comment posted <br />\n**Star** the star that users give to the movie (from 1 to 5, 5 grades) <br />\n**Comment** the content of the comment <br />\n**Like** the count of \"like\" on the comment <br />",

We deleted the duplicated comments and made a moive stop-word list.\n\n\n2.Using ti-idfs as independent variables to predict the sentiment¶\n\nWe first tried to build lda and lsa topic models to make prediction(the same as project 3 method), but the result is not ideal. No mather we used either model, the probability of prediction is around the random guess's probability. Therefore, we move our direction to using ti-idfs as dependent variables to build our model after refering to other nlp sentiment prediction projects. We uses several classification models, then print out their classification report and draw ROC plot. We choose the best model according to both the f1-score and AUC score.\n\n\nMultinomial NB¶\n\nLogistic Regression¶\n\nLinear SVM¶\n\nPerception¶\n\nMLP Classifier¶\n\nGradientBoost¶\n\nAdaBoost¶\n\n3.Build the LSA and LDA topic models for the reviews¶\n\nWe use two models LDA and LSA to handle the review documents. For each model, we use the corpus after applying tf-idf and dictionary to fit the model and get several topics. Secondly, we use coherence values to find the optimal topic number.Coherence value help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. So we use that with highest score to decide the number of topic. Then, we print the topics and the score of each topic for the reviews.\n\n\nLDA-choose the topic number¶We first choose the optimal topic number.\n\n\nLDA-build the model¶\n\nLSA-choose the topic number¶\n\nLSA-build the model¶\n\n4.Now, let's use a new film 'Frozen' to test our model!¶",

        "input": "### Context\n\nFast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of service. It is a commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated, or precooked ingredients and served in packaging for take-out/take-away. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers, and wage workers. In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.\n\nThe fastest form of \"fast food\" consists of pre-cooked meals which reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets, primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's, use mass-produced, pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables that are pre-washed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) and cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling \"to order\".\n\nFast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no shelter or seating, or fast food restaurants (also known as quick service restaurants). Franchise operations that are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central locations.\n\n### Content\n\nIn this Dataset, we have various information about the top 50 Fast-Food chains in the USA (2021). The key features of this Dataset are - Fast-Food Chains, U.S. Systemwide Sales (Millions - U.S Dollars), Average Sales per Unit (Thousands - U.S Dollars), Franchised Stores, Company Stores, 2021 Total Units, Total Change in Units from 2020.

        "output": "About the dataset¶This dataset is about the show about \"nothing\". Yeah, you guessed it right. I am talking about Seinfeld, one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. This dataset provides episodic analysis of the series including the entire script and significant amount of information about each episode.\n\n\nWhat have I done here?¶I have tried to create a classifier to predict the name of the speaker of a given dialogue. I have used the scripts database for this purpose. So, if a line is given to the predictor, it returns the person who said or might say that line.\n\n\nNow, we don't really require the EpisodeNo, SEID and Season columns so we remove them.\n\n\nTime for some EDA\n\n\nPlot by number of dialogues spoken¶\n\nFor creating a corpus out of the data, we will create a datframe concatenating all dialogues of a character. We are choosing 12 characters(by number of dialogues)\n\n\nPreparing stopwords(words that are obsolete for NLP or words that hinder modelling). Very helpful in human speech but useless when trained for modelling¶\n\nNow, we create a text_processor function to tokenize concatenated dialogues and removing stop words\n\n\nNow, we apply this method\n\n\nAdding a length column to the new dataframe which contains length of the concatenated dialogues\n\n\nWho has spoken the most in Seinfeld?¶\n\nObviously, Jerry speaks the most followed by George, Elaine and Kramer\n\n\nNow, we do some correlation analysis  to find out how similar are the dialogues of different characters to each other.\n(For this, we will use a library called gensim. Next cell is the most important yet.)\n\n\nHeatmap to detect similarity between characters' dialogues¶\n\nThis plot can actually depict how different the characters are from each other. Like Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer speak highly similar lines. Maybe, that's why they are friends(This might have happened because they are usually talking to each other and also because their dialogues are mumore than others). [Setting] has lowest correlation scores well because it is the odd one out because it is not a person. Jerry and George have highly similar dialogues with 81%  correlation.\n\n\nAn awesome way to use classification¶I am predicting the dialogues said by Elaine, George and Kramer only, so we will choose only their dialogues(I wanted to include Jerry, I mean what is Seinfeld without Jerry Seinfeld but I will later tell you why I didn't do that. Look for clues in markdown)\n\n\nWay too many dialogues by george will certainly affect the classifier.\n\n\nA text processor for processing dialogues¶\n\nPreparation for classifier¶\n\nTF-IDF Vectorizer¶Convert a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features. Equivalent to CountVectorizer followed by TfidfTransformer.\nIn information retrieval, tfâidf or TFIDF, short for term frequencyâinverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Nowadays, tf-idf is one of the most popular term-weighting schemes; 83% of text-based recommender systems in the domain of digital libraries use tf-idf.\n\n\nCreating a voting classifier with Multinomial Naive Bayes, logistic regression and random forest classifier¶The EnsembleVoteClassifier is a meta-classifier for combining similar or conceptually different machine learning classifiers for classification via majority or plurality voting.\nThe EnsembleVoteClassifier implements \"hard\" and \"soft\" voting. In hard voting, we predict the final class label as the class label that has been predicted most frequently by the classification models. In soft voting, we predict the class labels by averaging the class-probabilities (only recommended if the classifiers are well-calibrated).\n\n\nSo we get about 51% precision which is not bad considering the limited vocablury. George is dominant here due to high recall value of 0.80. So, unless a dialogue has words that don't exist at all in George's vocablury, there is a high chance George will the speaker of most lines. The situation was worse when Jerry was inclued. This is why I decided to drop Jerry's dialogues from the dataset.\n\n\nThe Predictor¶\n\nNow, we predict...¶\n\nSee, this \"george effect\" can lead to awkward results. That's why I am trying to find a way to get rid of that high recall value and also improve the precision of classifier.\n\n\nTime to use keras for this purpose (Simple ANN approach)¶\n\nI have used Keras which is a high-level Neural Networks API built on top of low level neural networks APIs like Tensorflow and Theano. As it is high-level, many things are already taken care of therefore it is easy to work with and a great tool to start with. Here's the documentation for keras.\nI have explained the working of keras for beginners in this kernel. Click here.\nRefer to this kernel to learn in detail about the basic approach for a classification model using keras. That kernel is based on numerical data and this one is based on textual data so there are bound to be some differences in both approaches.(If anything, this model requires more layers)\n\n\nFirst, we import libraries.\n\n\nThis would delete the 3rd column of the matrix to prevent the dummy variable trap¶Click here to know more about Dummy Variable trap\n\n\nCreating the model.\n\n\nCompiling the model.\n\n\nFitting and predicting the model\n\n\nSo the training set accuracy is 83% which is much better than the Voted Classifier we prepared previously.¶\n\nSo the test set accuracy is 84.17% which is even better than training set.¶\n\nThis was a basic ANN approach which has shown great improvement over a simple voted classifier.\n\n\nOn a side note, this new GPU feature is very helpful.

        "input": "### Context\n\nHumans (and many other animals) have the ability to reduce or suppress their brains' responses to sensory consequences that are a result of their own actions.  The nervous system accomplishes this with a  corollary discharge forward model system in which an \"efference copy\" of an impending motor plan is transmitted from motor to sensory cortex where it generates a \"corollary discharge\" representation of the expected sensory consequences of the imminent motor act.  For example, when you move your eyes from left to right, your brain knows the environment is not shifting.  When you speak, your auditory cortex has a reduced response to the expected sound of your voice.\n\nSchizophrenia is a chronic mental illness that affects about 1% of people across the globe.  One possible explanation for some of the symptoms of schizophrenia is that one or more problems with the corollary discharge process in the nervous system makes it difficult for patients to differentiate between internally and externally generated stimuli.  Therefore, studying this process and its relationship to symptoms in the illness might allow us to better understand abnormal brain processes in patients with this diagnosis.\n\nIn a previously published EEG experiment ([full report][1]), we used a simple button pressing task in which subjects either (1) pressed a button to immediately generated a tone, (2) passively listened to the same tone, or (3) pressed a button without generating a tone to study the corollary discharge in people with schizophrenia and comparison controls.  We found that comparison controls suppressed the N100, a negative deflection in EEG brain wave 100 milliseconds after the onset of a sound, when they pressed a button to generate a tone compared to passive playback, but patients with schizophrenia did not.  This data set is a larger sample replication of that previous study.  Specifically, EEG data from 22 controls and 36 patients with schizophrenia have been combined with 10 controls and 13 patients from the previous report.\n\n### Methods\n\nDue to the size of the raw EEG data, some pre-processing was done prior to upload.  EEG data acquisition parameters and the experimental task was identical to that described in our paper.  However, pre-processing differed.  All individual subject data had at least the following data processing steps applied, in this order:\n\n 1. Re-reference to averaged ear lobes\n\n2.  0.1 Hz high-pass filter\n\n3.  Interpolation of outlier channels in the continuous EEG data (outliers defined as in [this paper][2])\n\n4.  Chop continous data into single trial epochs 1.5 seconds before and after task events (3s total)\n\n5.  Baseline correction -100 to 0ms\n\n6.  Canonical correlation analysis to remove muscle and high-frequency white noise artifacts\n\n7.  Rejection of outlier single trials (outliers defined as in [this paper][3])\n\n8.  Removal of outlier components from a spatial independent components analysis (outliers defined as in [this paper][4])\n\n9.  Interpolation of outlier channels within single trials (outliers defined as in [this paper][5])\n\nDerived data includes event-related potential (ERP) averages for 9 electrode sites analyzed in our previous report, including Fz, FCz, Cz, FC3, FC4, C3, C4, CP3, CP4 (pictured below):\n\n![montage][6]\n\nThe ERPs are calculated by averaging across trials for every sample in the time series, separately for each subject, electrode, and condition.\n\n### Content\n\nThe single trial data from all 64 channels are too large to be uploaded for all 81 subjects, but those interested in that type of data will find twenty four subjects (e.g. subject 21 in **21.csv/21.csv**) among the data files.  This includes all their data after the pre-processing step 9 listed above.  Additional subjects are being shared here:\n[https://www.kaggle.com/broach/buttontonesz2][7]\n\nFor those interested in comparing patients with schizophrenia to control subjects, the **ERPdata.csv** file contains the averaged, ERP time series for all subjects, conditions, and the 9 electrodes mentioned above.  These data, along with the subject information in **demographic.csv** could be used to replicate the analyses in our prior report.\n\nFor those interested in single trial categorization/prediction like the [grasp-and-lift][8] challenge or the [face decoding][9] challenge, the **mergedTrialData.csv** contains summary measurements from nearly 24,000 individual trials (all subjects and conditions are included).\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nFunding for the study procedures, initial analyses and publications came from the National Institute of Mental Health.

Understanding the cost of living is crucial for individuals, businesses, and policymakers alike, as it impacts decisions related to travel, relocation, investment, and economic analysis. This dataset is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, data analysts, and anyone interested in exploring and comparing the cost of living across different nations.\n\n#Content:\n\nThis dataset comprises four primary columns:\n\n**1. Countries:** This column contains the names of various countries included in the dataset. Each country is identified by its official name.\n\n**2. Cost of Living:** The \"Cost of Living\" column represents the cost of living index or score for each country. This index is typically calculated by considering various factors, such as housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and other essential expenses. A higher index value indicates a higher cost of living in that particular country, while a lower value suggests a more affordable cost of living.\n\n**3. 2017 Global Rank:** This column provides the global ranking of each country's cost of living in the year 2017. The ranking is based on the cost of living index mentioned earlier. A lower rank indicates a lower cost of living relative to other countries, while a higher rank suggests a higher cost of living position.\n\n**4. Available Data**: The \"Available Data\" column indicates whether or not data for a specific country and year is available. \n\nThis dataset is designed to support various data analysis and visualization tasks. Users can explore trends in the cost of living, identify countries with high or low cost of living, and analyze how rankings have changed over time. Researchers can use this dataset to conduct in-depth studies on the factors influencing the cost of living in different regions and the economic implications of such variations.\n\nPlease note that the dataset includes information for the year 2017, and users are encouraged to consider this when interpreting the data, as economic conditions and the cost of living may have changed since then. Additionally, this dataset aims to provide a snapshot of cost of living rankings for countries in 2017 and may not cover every country in the world.\n\nLink: \nhttps://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/cost_of_living_wb/\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe accuracy and completeness of the data provided in this dataset are subject to the source from which it was obtained.

However, doubts about the reliability of the data are probably unnecessary, as this disparity is quite predictable and understandable. But the difference between the 10 most expensive and the poorest countries is still striking.\n2 out of 4 countries are located in the northern latitudes (Iceland, Norway). This automatically complicates a large number of the usual life processes, and, accordingly, their cost. At the very least, growing agricultural products is extremely difficult. In addition, also 2 of the 4 countries are island states (Bermuda, Iceland), which also affects the cost of goods produced outside their borders.\nOn the other hand, for least_10, there may be many reasons for such a low cost of living:\n\nIt is quite possible that the economic situation in the country is difficult, which entails low purchasing power of the population. \nClosed domestic market, low level of competitiveness, low quality of goods, etc. \nOr, on the contrary, a large abundance of products, which makes it impossible for prices for goods and services to rise beyond the \"acceptable\" level within the country. \n\nIn general, the cost of living is an indicator of the cost of living only, and nothing more. It can be used as an auxiliary indicator in deeper studies, acting only as an explanatory factor that will shed light on certain research questions. After all, a high cost of living can be both an indicator of a country's welfare and an indicator of an extremely difficult situation within the state.\n\n\nIs there a connection between the cost of living in a country and the continent on which it is located?¶\ndf['Continent'] = coco.convert(names = df['Countries'], to = 'continent')\ndf.head(10)\n# List of categorical columns to be label encoded\ncategorical_columns = ['Continent']\ncolumns_to_drop = ['Available data', 'Global rank', 'Countries']\n\ndf_encoded = df.copy()\ndf_encoded = df_encoded.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)\n\n# Initialize the LabelEncoder for each column and apply label encoding\nlabel_encoders = {}\nfor column in categorical_columns:\n    label_encoders[column] = LabelEncoder()\n    df_encoded[column] = label_encoders[column].fit_transform(df_encoded[column])\n\n    \ncorr = df_encoded.corr()\n\n#display correlation matrix\ndisplay(corr['Cost of living, 2017'].sort_values(ascending = False))\n\nThe correlation between the cost of living in a country and the continent on which it is located is 0.333463.\nThis positive correlation value indicates that there is a weak positive relationship between the cost of living in 2017 and the continent to which the country belongs. \nThe correlation of 0.333463 is relatively close to 0, indicating that the two variables are not strongly related.

        "input": "##Introduction\n\nThe Mobile phone activity dataset is composed by one week of Call Details Records (CDRs) from the city of Milan and the Province of Trentino (Italy). \n\n## Description of the dataset\nEvery time a user engages a telecommunication interaction, a Radio Base Station (RBS) is assigned by the operator and delivers the communication through the network. Then, a new CDR is created recording the time of the interaction and the RBS which handled it. The following activities are present in the dataset: \n\n - received SMS\n - sent SMS\n - incoming calls\n - outgoing calls\n - Internet activity\n\nIn particular, Internet activity is generated each time a user starts an Internet connection or ends an Internet connection. Moreover, during the same connection a CDR is generated if the connection lasts for more than 15 min or the user transferred more than 5 MB. \n\nThe datasets is spatially aggregated in a square cells grid. The area of Milan is composed of a grid overlay of 1,000 (squares with size of about 235×235 meters. This grid is projected with the WGS84 (EPSG:4326) standard. For more details we link the original paper http://go.nature.com/2fcOX5E\n\nThe data provides CellID, CountryCode and all the aforementioned telecommunication activities aggregated every 60 minutes.\n\n\n## Original datasource\nThe Mobile phone activity dataset is a part of the Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge 2014, which is a rich and open multi-source aggregation of telecommunications, weather, news, social networks and electricity data from the city of Milan and the Province of Trentino (Italy).  The original dataset has been created by Telecom Italia in association with EIT ICT Labs, SpazioDati, MIT Media Lab, Northeastern University, Polytechnic University of Milan, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, University of Trento and Trento RISE.\nIn order to make it easy-to-use, here we provide a subset of telecommunications data that allows researchers to design algorithms able to exploit an enormous number of behavioral and social indicators. The complete version of the dataset is available at the following link: http://go.nature.com/2fz4AFr\n\n\n## Relevant, external, data sources\nThe presented datasets can be enriched by using census data provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) (http://www.istat.it/en/), a public research organization and the main provider of official statistics in Italy. The census data have been released for 1999, 2001 and 2011. \nThe dataset (http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/104317), released in Italian, is composed of four parts: Territorial Bases (Basi Territoriali), Administrative Boundaries (Confini Amministrativi), Census Variables (Variabili Censuarie) and data about Toponymy (Dati Toponomastici).\n\nMotivational video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d2_RWMsUKc\n\n\n## Relevant papers\nBlondel, Vincent D., Adeline Decuyper, and Gautier Krings. \"A survey of results on mobile phone datasets analysis.\" *EPJ Data Science 4*, no. 1 (2015): 1.\n\nFrancesco Calabrese, Laura Ferrari, and Vincent D.

The dataset (.xlsx) has over two dozen variables including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic readings), anthropometrics (body mass index, waist circumference), and a range of other socio-economic and demographic variables. A brief description of the dataset is provided below.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all volunteers for their help and all participants who showed up in our screening events nationwide. Also thanks to the original contributors of the dataset (acknowledgment has been published [elsewhere](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartjsupp/article/21/Supplement_D/D83/5476850))\n \n### Inspiration\n\nTo tackle the growing burden of chronic diseases, globally, we must:\n1. Quantify the disease burden locally?\n2. Understand the different factors affecting the rapid surge in the burden/incidence of the disease?\n3. Apply the learnings into policy and action.\n",

To answer key business questions, I used the course framework Ask, Prepare, Analyse, Share and Act.\nScenario¶You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâs future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\nAsk¶\nWhat topic are you exploring?\nCyclistic, a bike-share company\nWhat is the problem you are trying to solve?\nmaximizing the number of annual memberships, a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members\nWhat metrics will you use to measure your data to achieve your objective?

This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are\nusing Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using ridersâ personally identifiable information. This\nmeans that you wonât be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the\nCyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.\n\n\nHow does it help you answer your question?\nIt contains all of the trend information Iâm looking for\n\nAre there any problems with the data?\nNo\n### Load Libraries\n\n\n\nProcess¶\nWhat tools are you choosing and why?\nRstudio as the dataset is very large and I can practice using R.\nHave you ensured your dataâs integrity?\nI have checked that data has a the accuracy, completeness, and quality of data as it's maintained\nWhat steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?\nI created a day_of_week and month columns to state when the user started their journey and changed them to factors to keep them in chronological order.\n\nI changed the start and end times into dates datatypes and then created a ride_length column to document the users time booking out their bike.\nI then removed all ride lengths below zero as these would be errors and removed all columns with blank rows.\n\nHow can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze?\nInspection of the new dataframe with colnames(), str() to check column names, datatypes and the first few rows\n\nHave you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?\nYes\n\n\n\n\nLoad tables¶\n\nCompare column names (all the same)¶\n\nCompare column datatypes (a lot of missing start/ end stations name/ids, start / end times in chr not time)¶\n\nCombine each month to create a large data_frame¶\n\nInspection of new table¶\n\nData Cleaning¶\n\nStatistics¶\n\nAnalyse¶\nHow should you organize your data to perform analysis on it?\nCreating pivot tables to take a closer look at the data\nHas your data been properly formatted?\nYes\nWhat surprises did you discover in the data?\nMean and median of the ride_length are very different. This shows that data has some skew and the median is giving a more realistic measure of distribution for this data.\n\nThe shortest ride length is 1 sec which is likely an error, longest ride is 3356649 seconds, which works out to be 38 days, 20 hours, 24 minutes, 9 seconds.\nThe day with the most rides is monday.\nI looked at the summary statistics for ride_length and day_of_week columns.\n\n\nPivot Tables¶\n\nVisuals¶\n\n\nWhat trends or relationships have you found in the data?\n\n\nCausal users take longer rides than member users\nMember users take more rides overall.\nCasual users have longer rides everyday of the week, with both users having the longest rides on the weekend, Sunday closely followed by Saturday.\nMember users have the highest number of rides on weekdays, while casual members have the most rides on weekends.\nSummer months have the highest amount of rides\nSpring and summer months have the longest duration\nMembers use more electric and classic bikes while are the only \n\n\nHow do these insights answer your question or solve the problem?\nwe now have a better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics\n\nShare¶\nWhat story does your data tell?\nHow causal riders and members differ in their user habits\nHow do your findings relate to your original question?\nWe now better understand how annual members and casual riders differ\nWho is your audience?

        "input": "# Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist\n\nWelcome! This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at [Olist Store](http://www.olist.com). The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.  \n\nThis is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.\n\n## Join it With the Marketing Funnel by Olist\nWe have also released a [Marketing Funnel Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist/home). You may join both datasets and see an order from Marketing perspective now! \n\n**Instructions on joining are available on this [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/andresionek/joining-marketing-funnel-with-brazilian-e-commerce).**\n\n## Context\nThis dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: [www.olist.com](https://www.olist.com)\n\nAfter a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.\n\n### Attention\n1. An order might have multiple items.\n2. Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.\n3. All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.\n\n### Example of a product listing on a marketplace\n![Example of a product listing on a marketplace](https://i.imgur.com/JuJMns1.png)\n\n## Data Schema\nThe data is divided in multiple datasets for better understanding and organization. Please refer to the following data schema when working with it:\n![Data Schema](https://i.imgur.com/HRhd2Y0.png)\n\n## Classified Dataset\nWe had previously released a classified dataset, but we removed it at *Version 6*. We intend to release it again as a new dataset with a new data schema. While we don't finish it, you may use the classified dataset available at the *Version 5* or previous.\n\n## Inspiration\nHere are some inspiration for possible outcomes from this dataset.\n\n**NLP:** <br>\nThis dataset offers a supreme environment to parse out the reviews text through its multiple dimensions.\n\n**Clustering:**<br> \nSome customers didn't write a review. But why are they happy or mad?\n\n**Sales Prediction:**<br> \nWith purchase date information you'll be able to predict future sales.\n\n**Delivery Performance:**<br> \nYou will also be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimize delivery times.\n\n**Product Quality:** <br>\nEnjoy yourself discovering the products categories that are more prone to customer insatisfaction.\n\n**Feature Engineering:** <br>\nCreate features from this rich dataset or attach some external public information to it.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThanks to Olist for releasing this dataset.",

The vast majority of these deaths **(94%)** occurred in low-resource settings, and most **could have been prevented**.\n\n&gt; In light of what was mentioned above, **Cardiotocograms (CTGs)** are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\n&gt; ## Data\nThis dataset contains **2126** records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into **3 classes**:\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n\n# How to use\n&gt; - Create a multiclass model to classify CTG features into the three fetal health states.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n&gt; If you use this dataset in your research, please credit the authors.\n\n&gt; ### Citation\nAyres de Campos et al.

The information is still useful for machine reading but not much for eyeballing.\n\n\nNext: let's try to \"fabricate\" candle sticks with different width (time window): 5 min, 30 min, 1h, etc.\n\n\nGroups¶Now, let's create groups that represent larget candle sticks, like 5min, 30min, 1h, etc.\nAs seen above, the data is too large to make sense to plot all of it in a single plot, so the last DISPLAY_LAST entries for each group would be visualised.\n\nDISPLAY_LAST = 100\ndef group_df(df: dd.DataFrame, freq: str = '1min'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a DataFrame grouped by the provided frequency. \n    This aims to represent candle stick with larger interval (equal to `freq`).\n    To achieve this a custom aggregation must be applied for each column in a group.\n    For example, `open` should be the first entry in the group and `close` - the last one. \n    `volume` should be the sum of all 1min volumns in this time window (freq).\n    \n    For an explanation of available `freq`s check the Pandas `Grouper` class.\n    \"\"\"\n    return df.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq=freq)).agg({\n        'open': 'first',\n        'high': 'max',\n        'low': 'min',\n        'close': 'last',\n        'volume': 'sum'\n    })\n\ngroup_df(df_1min, '1min').tail()\ndf_1min.tail()\n\nThe two outputs above are a simple test check that the group_df function applies proper aggregation to each group.\n\n\n1min¶\ndf_1min = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='1min'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_1min.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_1min.tail()\n\n5min¶\ndf_5min = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='5min'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_5min.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_5min.tail()\n\n30 min¶\ndf_30min = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='30min'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_30min.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_30min.tail()\n\n1h¶\ndf_1h = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='1h'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_1h.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_1h.tail()\n\n2h¶\ndf_2h = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='2h'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_2h.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_2h.tail()\n\n6h¶\ndf_6h = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='6h'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_6h.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_6h.tail()\n\n12h¶\ndf_12h = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='12h'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_12h.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_12h.tail()\n\n24h¶\ndf_24h = apply_change(group_df(df, freq='24h'))\ndisplay_changes(\n    df_24h.tail(DISPLAY_LAST)\n)\ndf_24h.tail()\n\nConclusion¶What can we say about the BTC-USDT trading pair based on thie visualisation?\n\nOne probable conclusion is that smaller time intervals bring smaller changes in the price of BTC. So if you want to base your algorithms on a larger % change you may need to wait for and observe larger time intervals - 6h+.\n\n\n\nNotes¶This notebook is a simple exploration of the data and there is no guarantee there are no bugs.

You use the command 'add_constant' so that statsmodels also fits an intercept. If you don't use this command, it will fit a line passing through the origin by default.\n\n\nThings we observe from above summary:\n\ncoefficients and p-value\nR-squared is 81.6% , which is very high and good for our model\nprob(F-statistic) is low, which mens that \"the fit is not by chance'. \n\n\ny_train_pred = lr_model.predict(X_train_sm)\ny_train_pred\nplt.scatter(X_train, y_train)\nplt.plot(X_train, y_train_pred , 'r')\nplt.show()\n\nYou visualised the predicted regression line on the scatter plot of the training data which is one of the things you should do as a part of model evaluation.\n\n\nStep 3: Residual Analysis¶\n\nAs we have the model whch predict value of y.\nerror = f(y_train, y_train_pred) = y_train - y_train_pred\n\nres = y_train - y_train_pred\nplt.figure()\nsns.displot(res, kde=True)\nplt.title(\"Residual distribution plot\")\nplt.show()\n\nAs we can seel the distribution of Residuals is Normal, Therefore it implicates that the assumptions are voilating.\n\n# we can also look for some patterns ( there should not be any pattrn between errors.)\n\nplt.scatter(X_train, res)\nplt.show()\n\nSo as it can be seen above that residuals in right half are having hiegher variance. these points shows spread of residuals.\n\n\nStep 4: Predictiona nd evaluation¶Now we will predict the response variable 'y' , and evaluate our Model on Test data.¶\n# Prediction on test set (y_test_pred)\n# Evaluate the model , R-squared, and other statistics.\n# add a contsnt/intercept to test\nX_test_sm = sm.add_constant(X_test)\n\n# Pred on test\ny_test_pred = lr_model.predict(X_test_sm)\n# Evaluate the model , R-squared, and other statistics on the test\n# to do this we need some libraries , that are \nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n# R-squared\nr_square = r2_score(y_true = y_test , y_pred = y_test_pred)\nr_square\nr_square_train = r2_score(y_true = y_train , y_pred = y_train_pred)\nr_square_train\n# mean_squared_error\nmean_squared_error(y_true = y_test , y_pred = y_test_pred)\n# ploting test\nplt.scatter(X_test , y_test)\nplt.plot(X_test , y_test_pred , 'r')\nplt.show()\nr = 4 \nc = 5\nfinal1 = [0]*c \nfinal = [(final1) for h in range(r)] \nprint(final1) \nprint(final)\n# Output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] Where is list of [0]*c got printed ?\nfor i in range(r): \n    for j in range(c): \n        if i==0 or j==0 or i==r-1 or j==c-1: \n            final[i][j] = 1\n            \nprint (final)",
